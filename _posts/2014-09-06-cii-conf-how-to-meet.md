... The more I study the situation in the 60s, the more I realize that those 12 years or so were a revival.
  
In my travels visiting the churches and the home meetings, I have come to realize that we have slipped some in our practice.
  
...
  
In the book How to Meet, one of the points mentioned is that we should meet on a `Round Table`; anything else you have groups; around a round table, everyone is engaged. I remember the talk concerning the meeting in the upper room and what that meant.
  
In another book called `Church Affairs` were messages given in 1948. it was a particular study on the matter of the practice of the church life. Some of the fellowship there was the [1 Cor. 14](http://online.recoveryversion.org/BibleChapters.asp?fcid=147&lcid=147) meeting.
  
Later, there was also fellowship for the new believers. In `Lessons for New Believers`, brother Lee enumarated all the types of christian meetings, such as:
  
* the prayer meeting
* meetings of the church
* meetings to preach the gospel ([Acts 5](http://online.recoveryversion.org/BibleChapters.asp?fcid=94&lcid=94) where they met from house to house to preach the gospel).
* meetings to read the Bible (Timothy was charged specifically for this kind of meeting). 
* meetings to hear reports of God's move and the Spirit's doing and work
* the Lord's table meeting
* others...
  
The believers should meet. Brohter Lee also gave some instructions on these meetings.
The depth of the significance of the Table meetings needs study and appreciation. Otherwise, the table meeting is light. The Lord's table with those symbols represents the entire economy of God.
Our meetings are "sing-alongs"; no real exercize of the spirit. Some singing and then quiet. The truth is that we have fallen into quite religious and traditional, formal in our meeting life. Thank the Lord that there's some exercize by some stronger or conscientious saints that prop up the meeting so it's not flat and totatlly dead. But as a whole, there is not the up-to-standard christian meeting according to the divine revelation. This causes me to be deeply burdened.
  
###Why are the christian meetings so important?###
This is why we need to study. My burden today is to put within you all a respect, an understanding of what the meeting means to use and to God. To upgrade our meetings is not to do something outward. The verses above have something to do with the "livingness" in the meetings.

* Because this is where God meets with His people.
  God's whole focus is on man, to put Himself in man and that mand and God would be inseparable, an organic entity forever. God desires to meet with us! What do you suppose you we will do in the New Jerusalem? We won't be playing golf or swimming...
    
  Why did God get close to man, seek out the sinners, let John recline on His breast? He wants to spend time with you and with me. his desire is to be with his people. Our meeting times are the times to meet with God, to have that fellowship time with God, to have a date... "Dad" wants to meet with His sons.

  The greatest blessing is to be in the presence of God. All the material things will betray you and leave you thirsty. The best that human life can give you will leave you panting. The human heart and spirit are panting for one thing - the very God Himself. This is why we meet.

  The meeting of God's people becomes God's dwelling. God said, "Heaven is my throne, the earth is my footstool... To this kind of man will I look, to him who is poor and of a contrite spirit, who trembles at My word." 

Read [Deut. 12](http://online.recoveryversion.org/BibleChapters.asp?fcid=425&lcid=425); Our place to meet is the place He has chosen. The Israelites were to tear down all of the places of worship of the people and meet at the place God chose.

* Because there God is expressed and testified
  [1 Cor. 14](http://online.recoveryversion.org/BibleChapters.asp?fcid=147&lcid=147) says that if all prophesy one by one and an unbeliever enters, he will say, "God is here." A real meeting is one where God is there. If God is absent, that is a religious meeting. God is seen, witnessed, expressed in a real meeting, where there are at least 2 gathered.
  If I come to a meeting with all the right practices but God is not there, that is just a religious meeting. But if I come to a meeting where no one can carry a tune, they don't know much, but God can be sensed there, that is a real meeting. Is God there? Is God expressed there?

  The testimony to the community is mainly in the meetings (the city on the hill). If our meetings are substandard, people do not see much. If God is in the midst in a meeting, the great attraction of the light in a dark place will draw them.

* Because there God's power is exercized
  Many things there are carried out for God, such as in the prayer meeting. In the prayer meeting, we meet in His name and exercize His authority to bind, loose, and execute the authority of God's kingdom on the earth; we battle and war. The meeting is the kingdom of God. Therefore, in a negative way, the meeting is for the devil also - to push him back, to deal with him.

What are we doing here? We meet again and again, but for what? Why are we meeting? What's the point? Study this on the verses; In Deuteronomy the word is to "Go, bring, offer, and worship." This kind of realizationshould change how we come and what we bring to the meetings. Please consider these things.

Study how God's people Israel met in the Old Testament:
* The Tabernacle of the Testimony - the portable dwelling place of God and The Temple - the greater and permanent dwelling place of God: the center of the Israeli life. 
  This tabernacle is Christ and also the enlarged Christ the Church. Today it is also more than that - the place where God dwells among His people and where He met with His people. This is why it was also called "The Tent of Meeting." Here he meets to speak, talk, shine, etc. This is also where man brings the offerings. The Israeli life was a meeting life. All the offerings were for the meetings. The insence refers to prayer, the lampstand, the enlightenment we receive from the Word. If you take away God, and all you have is insence, a lamp, an offering; what is the purpose?? Our reading the word, prayer, eating, etc. are so that we can go and meet with God. This is the aim and purpose. All of the labor on the Good land to have the tithing is so that we can offer it to offer when we meet.
  How fresh is your consecration to the Lord? Is it 15 years old?

In the church age, where there are two or three gathered together, there God is in the midst. This is the greatest prophesy God can make His people. "I will be pneumatized and I promise to be there in your midst." From the smallest gathering of two. This is what makes your gathering special.

In our gatherings, what you do is not so important; what's important is if the Lord is there. We don't gather ourselves; the Lord calls the meeting. When we do not go, we disgrace the Gatherers. He calls us out of everything, every occupation to gather.

At our typical meeting, 5% show up at the appointed time, 25% show up 15 minutes late; 40% show up 30 minutes late, and the rest are there by 45 minutes. When the Lord gathers us, we have His presence. When we have His presence we also have his __power__, the __power of grace__, the __power to heal__ (if you're sick), the __power to enlightened__ (when you are in darkness), the __power to resurrect__ (if you're dead). We may be struggling in some way; but when we meet, we receive Him, the promise of Emmanuel. We can receive something at home, but often we can only receive what we need in the meetings. The great I am is in the meetings. Why do we meet together? B/c the _I Am_ is there. ... _In their midst_
  
On the night of His resurrection, He was suddenly "In their midst". There he 'breathed into them'. In Luke, the emphasis of that night is that He also 'opened their understanding' with the Word. In both passages, he said to them "Peace be to you." In no other place do we have that sense of security and certainty. 

This verse is the first mention of a Christian meeting in the New Testament; many principles are here. We should start with this point.

I am very burdened and concerned. We have many weekly meetings. That's good. But I think we need to go much higher and deeper. The Lord wants this and needs this for His testimony here in Irvine. For the testimony to the community, the people, our own enjoyment, and even the devil. I'd like to see the Church in Irvine to be unrecognizable in a year's time. Unrecognizable, revolutionized. 

The main thing is to contact the Lord. We will give Him our presence and He will give us His presence. His presence is joy to us and visa versa. After every meeting everyone should be happy. But with our current situation, after a meeting, we may say, "I'm not coming next week." It shouldn't be this way. Let's go backt o His promise - 'For where two or three are gathered into My name, there am I in their midst."

Later we will cover this, but one of the reasons are meetings are not up-to-standard is that there is a lack of exercize.

With the Lord, His presence, when He is there, it is unreligious, unorganized, and it's unpredictable. You just think about so many of our meetings are quite organized, religious, ritualistic - our Church Life rituals; and predictable; always the same. I don't mean we do some strange things, but that there is room for the Spirit to move; things are unpredictable. Today in one sense He comes by Himself; in another way, we bring Him to the meetings.
