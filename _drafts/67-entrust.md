**Dictionary definition** : to charge or **invest with a trust** or responsibility; **to commit** (something) in trust to; **to confide** , as for care, use, or performance.

**Scriptures:** (No relevant verses on entrust, so we use the word commit)

Psa 22:8 **He committed himself to Jehovah** ; let Him rescue him; "Let Him deliver him since He takes pleasure in him."

Psa. 31:5 **Into Your hand I commit my spirit;** / Redeem me, O Jehovah, God of truth.

Psa. 37:5 **Commit your way to Jehovah** , / And trust in Him; and He will act.

Acts 14:23 And when they had appointed elders for them in every church and had prayed with fastings, **they committed them to the Lord** into whom they had believed.

Acts 20:32 And **now I commit you to God and to the word of His grace** , which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who have been sanctified.

2 Tim. 1:12 For which cause also I suffer these things; but I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, **and I am persuaded that He is able to guard my deposit unto that day** .

**Footnotes** :

2 Tim 1:123 The apostle believed not a thing or a matter but a living person, Christ, the Son of the living God, who is the embodiment of divine grace and eternal life. The eternal life in Him is powerful; it is more than able to sustain to the end the one who suffers for His sake, and to preserve him for the inheritance of the coming glory. The grace in Him was more than sufficient to provide His sent one with all he needed for finishing the course of his ministry unto a reward in glory (4:7-8). Hence, He was able to guard that which the apostle had committed unto Him for the day of His return. Such an assurance must also have been an encouragement and strengthening to the enfeebled and sorrowful Timothy.

2 Tim 1:124 Or, that which I have committed unto Him. The apostle committed his entire being with his glorious future unto the One who was able, through His life and grace, to guard his deposit for the day of His second appearing.

**Ministry Excerpts** :

Now we know that only Christ can overcome. We also know that Christ is living within us. We know moreover that when we believe, we have Christ. Yet day after day we remain the same and nothing is changed. What should we do so that we can let Christ live His life out of us? There are two ways or, one may say, two conditions.

It is true that Christ is in us. But if we do not allow Him to work, He will not work. **We must submit ourselves to God.** What is to surrender? Surrendering is to not promise God that we will do His will and do good; it is to not covenant with God to do what we cannot do. **Surrendering is to let our hands go from our life. It is putting into God's hand our good, evil, merits, shortcomings, our past, future, problems, life, and ourselves, and singleheartedly allowing Him to work.**

**If you do not let your hands go, God cannot live His life out of you. Suppose you are giving a book to someone. If your hand does not let go of the book, the other person cannot have your book. When you come to God, you should tell Him, "I am giving You all that I have, including my good, evil, what I want, what I do not want, what I will, what I will not, what I can do, and what I cannot do."** Are you willing to do this? If you are not willing to do even this, God will not be able to do anything. Are you willing to hand over the "you" that has failed? You have to be responsible for this step. **Today God only asks you to do one thing: hand over yourself** , the sinner, to Him. (_Collected Works of Watchman Nee, Vol. 8_, p. 153)

What are the necessary conditions for us to be guarded by the Lord? There are two conditions. **First, we must commit ourselves into the Lord's hand. Second Timothy 1:12 says, "He is able to guard my deposit unto that day."** The Lord will guard us, but **we have to commit ourselves into His hand. The degree to which we commit will be the extent to which He will guard.** If we do not commit ourselves into His hand, He cannot guard us in any way. Many people read the Bible and find that the Lord has preserving grace. Yet they also find that they cannot appropriate this promise. This is because they have not committed themselves to the Lord. Many people have known Jude 24 and 25 and Philippians 1:6 for many years, but they cannot believe that these words are real. They are satisfied if they can rise up after they have fallen. They have not committed themselves into the Lord's hand to allow the Lord to guard them from stumbling. They cannot experience the Lord's guarding this way. In order to experience the Lord's guarding, we must say to the Lord, "I commit myself to Your guarding. I believe in Your guarding power." A sister once asked me to rent a deposit box in the bank, and the bank charged six dollars. But our Lord's guarding is free as long as we are willing to commit ourselves to Him.

Second, we have to believe in the Lord's guarding power. First Peter 1:5 says that we are being guarded by the power of God "through faith." In order for us to experience the Lord's guarding, committing ourselves to Him is not enough. We also have to believe in God's guarding power. Suppose I asked Brother Luk to take a sum of money to another person. I have to believe that Brother Luk has the power to guard the money I committed to him. If I truly believe in him and commit the money to him, I will not need to go repeatedly to him and ask if my money is still in his hand. **After we have committed ourselves to the Lord, we do not have to repeatedly ask Him what He is going to do. Will the God of the heavens and earth not guard us well? God's word upholds all things. Is He not able to uphold us? God does not guard us as if He were guarding a piece of worthless paper. No! He guards us like the pupil of His eye** (Deut. 32:10). In the same way that a finger is joined to the body, He has joined us to Himself and constituted us members of Christ by His life. We have to believe that He is well able to guard us. Our eyes should be set on the Lord and not on our experience. The only things that are trustworthy are the Lord's power His Word and His love. Our experience is not trustworthy at all. **For I know whom I have believed and I am persuaded that He is able to guard my deposit unto that day (2 Tim. 1:12)** . (Collected Works of Watchman Nee, Vol. 41, pp. 127-128)

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 680** _

1. "All in His hands"—what confidence it bringsTo tested hearts, to know that all the thingsThat make up life and circumstance, He holdsIn His strong hands, and patiently unfoldsTh' eternal purpose of His sovereign Will—That all things shall His grace and glory fill.

1. "All in His hands"? Then life with purpose movesWithin the circle of His will, and provesIt good, acceptable. The hands of manOr Satan cannot mar or foil the planWhich God ordained—to manifest His SonIn earthen vessels, to a world undone.

_ **Hymn 1285, ss. 1-2 & chorus** _

1. The faith which once for all was giv'nUnto the saints of old,Has been committed unto usTo guard, defend, and hold.

And we know whom we have believed  
And are persuaded that He is able  
To guard, through the Holy Spirit,  
Our deposit to that day.

1. This good deposit is the markOf God's economy,Without it we will miss the aimOf His recovery.

_ **Hymn 564** _

1 I have learned the wondrous secret  
Of abiding in the Lord;  
I have tasted life's pure fountain,  
I am drinking of His word;  
I have found the strength and sweetness  
Of abiding 'neath the blood;  
I have lost myself in Jesus,  
I am sinking into God.

I'm abiding in the Lord  
And confiding in His word;  
I am hiding in the bosom of His love.  
Yes, abiding in the Lord  
And confiding in His word,  
I am hiding in the bosom of His love.

2I am crucified with Jesus,  
And He lives and dwells with me;  
I have ceased from all my struggling,  
'Tis no longer I, but He.  
All my will is yielding to Him,  
And His Spirit reigns within;  
And His precious blood each moment  
Keeps me cleansed and free from sin.

3All my sicknesses I bring Him,  
And He bears them all away;  
All my fears and griefs I tell Him,  
All my cares from day to day,  
All my strength I draw from Jesus,  
By His breath I live and move;  
E'en His very mind He gives me,  
And His faith, and life, and love.

4For my words I take His wisdom,  
For my works His Spirit's power;  
For my ways His ceaseless presence  
Guards and guides me every hour.  
Of my heart, He is the portion,  
Of my joy the boundless spring;  
Savior, Sanctifier, Healer,  
Glorious Lord, and coming King.
