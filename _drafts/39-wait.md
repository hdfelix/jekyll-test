**Scriptures** :

Psa. 27:14 **Wait for Jehovah; / Be strong, and let your heart be encouraged. / Yes, wait for Jehovah.**

Psa. 62:1 **My soul waits in silence for God alone** ; / My salvation is from Him.

Psa. 130:5 **I wait for Jehovah; my soul waits, / And in His word I hope.**

Isa. 30:18 And therefore Jehovah waits to be gracious to you, / And therefore He remains on high to have compassion on you; / For Jehovah is a God of justice; / **Blessed are those who wait for Him.**

Isa. 40:31 **Yet those who wait on Jehovah will renew their strength** ; / They will mount up with wings like eagles; / They will run and will not faint; / They will walk and will not become weary.

**Footnotes** :

Isa 40:31, note 1, par.1 **To wait on the eternal God (v. 28) means that we terminate ourselves, i.e., that we stop ourselves with our living, our doing, and our activity, and receive God in Christ as our life, our person, and our replacement. Such a waiting one will be renewed and strengthened to such an extent that he will mount up with wings like eagles. He will not only walk and run but also soar in the heavens, far above every earthly frustration. This is a transformed person** . This chapter leads us to a comparison between Hezekiah, a godly man who was still in the old creation (chs. 36—39), and a regenerated and transformed person in the new creation.

Isa 40:31, note 2 The eagles' wings signify the resurrection power of Christ, God's power in life, becoming our grace (cf. 1 Cor. 15:10; 2 Cor. 4:7; 12:9a). **Those who stop themselves and wait on Jehovah will experience the power of resurrection, will be transformed, and will soar in the heavens** (cf. Phil. 4:13; Col. 1:11).

**Ministry Excerpts** :

Many people think that they need to wait on God when He does not answer their prayers. Generally speaking, this can be considered as waiting on the Lord. This is an outward waiting. **However, we are speaking of the waiting that transpires in our spirit** . Suppose we are calm and turn to our spirit, but we do not sense that we have the presence of God. As a spiritual fact God never leaves us, but in our experience we may sense that He is far away or that He is near us **. At times we may feel that He is near, but He has not initiated anything. When this happens, we should not say anything quickly. Rather, we should spend some time to wait in His presence** .

God should always take the full initiative in our prayer, and we should simply follow. We should pray according to the feelings He gives us. In the same principle, sometimes He purposely delays His coming so that we learn to wait on Him. We cannot care merely for our convenience. **We must care for His convenience and wait. We should never be rash or impatient. For this reason the psalms say that we should wait on the Lord** .

This kind of waiting is not an easy matter. We would not consider two hours to be too long to converse with a close friend, but **we would consider two hours to be a long time to wait. Waiting requires patience** . When we pray, there is also the need to wait on God. Sometimes God likes to test us in our prayer. **If He does not seem to be near us after we turn to our spirit, and there are no feelings within, we should not initiate anything. If there is no feeling within, there can be no prayer. We should learn to wait. When He moves, we should follow, and when He does not move, we should wait on Him.**

Can we spend half an hour to quietly wait on Him without uttering any words? Can we happily tell others that we spent our morning waiting on the Lord in this way? Can we wait for a long time without praying to Him? Perhaps after waiting for some time, we may need to say, "Lord, I must go to work. I am unable to wait on You any longer." Can we do this (_How to Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God_, Chapter 21)?

**We should learn towait on God. This is a trying lesson. Even in human relationships waiting is an important element.** Suppose I want a brother to help me. If he is busy when I go to see him, I cannot make my request. I must wait until he is no longer busy before I can open my mouth. We should not think that we can skip this step when we pray. Many times when God asks us to do something for Him, He does not force us. He waits until we are ready. **If God can wait on us, should we notwait on God?**

**The book of Psalms is filled with the matter of waiting on God. In the prayers of the psalmists the wordwaitingis uttered numerous times. We need towait on Jehovah (37:9). Our soul should wait in silence for God alone** (62:1). We cannot breathe in God without first waiting on Him. **Waiting on God is to allow Him to determine the timing. We cannot dictate the time; He dictates the time. We need to wait. When we pray, we need to inquire of God, and we also need towait on God** (_How to Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God_, Chapter 5).

Therefore, when we pray, we must not only turn to our spirit, but **we must also**** wait on ****God's initiation** . We should be calm and turn to our spirit. At the same time we should not be too quick to utter something. Rather, we should wait for God's initiation and the sense in our spirit. Please remember that everyone who opens his mouth quickly speaks invariably from himself and from his own initiation. Whenever we pray, we must learn to turn to our spirit. **Then we must learn to wait for God's initiation. We should be calm and touch the sense in our spirit in order to pray according to that sense** (_How to Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God_, Chapter 20).

We should allow God's Spirit to lead us into His heart. We should spend time to learn this lesson. When we first begin to pray in this way, there is no need to say or consider much. Our heart should be calm and undisturbed. We can bring the things we have encountered into God's presence and consider them, or we can forget about these things and simply meditate on God's Word. We can remain in His presence, touching God in our spirit and allowing God to touch us in the spirit. **Actually, we do not have to go to God to touch Him; we can simply wait on Him. While we wait on Him in this way, something will come to our attention, and we will gain something. Then we will touch God's desire. The greatest wisdom comes from this kind of waiting. In this way our desires are mingled with God's desires, and our thoughts are one with God's thoughts. Based on this, we can pray to God.** (_The Collected Works of Watchman Nee, vol. 38, pp.453-454_)

Ever by Thee to pray—

Make all my prayer to Thee

Thyself expressed thru me,

Give me Thy secret key—

Waiting on Thee, waiting on Thee.

_ **Hymn 793** _

1My soul, be silent, wait upon the Lord!

First let Him speak to thee, then speak to Him;

True prayer in thee the Lord initiates,

Thou but a channel art expressing Him.

2My soul, be silent, wait upon the Lord!

Learn to deny thy thought and all thy will.

Learn to let God anoint thee with Himself

And thru thy prayer His purposes fulfill.

3My soul, be silent, wait upon the Lord!

Silent to all thy wishes and thy plans,

Silent to all thy earthly cares and calls,

That God may work in thee all His demands.

4My soul, be silent, wait upon the Lord!

Yield to the spirit all thy heart and mind;

Here let the spirit show what God reveals,

Thee its obedient servant thus to find.

5My soul, be silent, wait upon the Lord!

Learn thus to let the Spirit pray thru thee;

All of thy being with the Spirit move,

Thy prayer will thus God's own expression be.

6My soul, be silent, wait upon the Lord!

Till in the spirit thou with God art one,

Till thru the spirit God possesses all

And thus transforms each part unto His Son.

7My soul, be silent, wait upon the Lord!

Till God may freely, fully flow thru thee,

Till all thy words and actions hour by hour

Are the fulfillment of God's will thru thee.
