**Scriptures** :

Num. 5:7 Then **they shall confess their sin which they have committed** , and he shall make restitution according to its principal for his wrong and add to it one-fifth of it and give it to the one whom he has wronged.

Psa. 32:5 I acknowledged my sin to You, / And I did not cover my iniquity. / **I said, I will confess my transgressions to Jehovah. / Then You forgave the iniquity of my sin.** Selah

Psa. 51:1 Be gracious to me, O God, according to Your lovingkindness; / According to the greatness of Your compassions blot out my transgressions. / 2 Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, / And from my sin cleanse me. / 3 For I do know my transgressions, / And my sin is before me continually. 4 Against You and You alone have I sinned, / And I have done what is evil in Your sight. / Therefore You are righteous when You speak; / You are clear when You judge. 5 Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, / And in sin did my mother conceive me.

Prov. 28:13 He who covers his transgressions will not prosper, / **But whoever confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy** .

1 John 1:9 **If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins** and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

**Footnotes** :

Gen. 3:111 God questioned Adam and Eve not because He intended to condemn them but because **He wanted to lead them to confess their transgressions** (cf. 1 John 1:9).

Num. 5:71 To deal with the guilt of our sinning against God is to deal with the defilement of unrighteousness, of being guilty before man and condemned before God. **After making a thorough confession of our sins to God (1 John 1:9), we should go to the one we have wronged to make restitution** in full for our trespass, even adding something to what we owe (Luke 19:8b).

Psa. 51:181 Verses 18-19 signify the participation in the enjoyment of God in the local church as God's house, God's dwelling, and in the universal church as God's city, God's kingdom, through the all-inclusive Christ as the offerings. **If we are those who repent, confess our sins, and ask God for His purging (1 John 1:9), we will have the enjoyment of God in Christ in His house, the local church, and in His city, the universal church.** This enjoyment, as the "good" mentioned here, includes God's building up the church, His filling the church with His glory, and His granting the church His rich presence with Himself as joy, peace, life, light, security, and every spiritual blessing (cf. Eph. 1:3).

1 John 1:91 **This denotes the confessing of our sins, our failures, after regeneration** , not the confessing of our sins before regeneration.

1 John 1:92 God is faithful in His word (v. 10) and righteous in the blood of Jesus His Son (v. 7). His word is the word of the truth of His gospel (Eph. 1:13), which tells us that He will forgive us our sins because of Christ (Acts 10:43); and the blood of Christ has fulfilled His righteous requirements that He might forgive us our sins (Matt. 26:28). **If we confess our sins, He, according to His word and based on the redemption through the blood of Jesus, forgives us because He must be faithful in His word and righteous in the blood of Jesus; otherwise, He would be unfaithful and unrighteous. Our confession is needed for His forgiveness. Such forgiveness of God, which is for the restoration of our fellowship with Him, is conditional; it depends on our confession** .

**Ministry Excerpts** :

Many have repented and were saved but have never thoroughly confessed their sins before God. Therefore, they do not have much joy of salvation or spiritual hunger, thirst, pursuit, or growth. **If we want to richly taste the Lord's joy of salvation, we must come before the Lord and thoroughly confess our sins. If we also want to have spiritual hunger, thirst, pursuit, and growth, we must come before God and confess our sins one by one. When we confess our sins to God in this way, we cannot be general; we cannot confess, in principle only, that we have sinned greatly. We must be specific and confess our sins one by one.** We cannot bring a bag of sins to God, throw it down before Him, and forget about it. We must open the bag of sins before God and mention each sin; we must open the bag and thoroughly confess each sin one by one. It is not sufficient to say to God, "I have committed many sins. I am full of sin. Please forgive me," and think that everything is all right. **We must ask God to search us, enlighten us, and expose all our sins so that we might see them and confess them to Him one by one. Only this is sufficient.**

When we pray to God in this way, He will enlighten us through the Holy Spirit and expose our previous sins one by one. He wants us to realize how we have offended our parents, brothers, and sisters; how we have wronged our wife or husband and children; and how we owe our teachers, fellow students, friends, relatives, and neighbors. He also wants us to realize how we cheated and stole from people, sought personal gain in public positions, profited at the expense of others, were falsely benevolent and falsely righteous, were evil in thoughts and devious in actions, and committed other sins and transgressions.

If we let Him enlighten us, He will uncover all our sins and enlighten us. **When we become aware of a sin, we should confess it to Him. We should confess our sins one by one until we feel that we do not need to confess anything more. If we practice this, we will be able to thoroughly confess our sins to God.** This is not related to our salvation; it is related to our living after salvation. It is not a requirement for salvation but a condition for spiritual growth. Receiving of the Lord's salvation is not based on this kind of confession; however, **those who have received the Lord's salvation should confess their sins in this way.** (_Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures, Vol. 2_, Chapter 8)

This does not mean that it is our confession alone that brings the inward filling of the Holy Spirit. **It means that confessing our sins empties out our being within, allowing the Holy Spirit to gain the proper ground within us.** After we have confessed our sins, we have peace within because **how many sins we have confessed is how much God has forgiven us, and how many sins we have confessed is how much the precious blood of the Lord Jesus has cleansed us.** The extent of the forgiveness of God is according to our confession. How much we confess is how much God forgives, **how deeply we confess is how deeply God forgives, and how broadly we confess is how broadly God forgives.** Following God's forgiveness, the precious blood of the Lord cleanses us. As we believe the forgiveness of God and receive the cleansing of the Lord's blood, we have peace within, and we also have the inward filling of the Holy Spirit. (_Bearing Remaining Fruit, Vol. 2_, Chapter 4)

One thing is certain: if the Spirit is going to pray through you concerning an important matter, He will first come to enlighten you and to purge your being. Whenever the Spirit is going to bring you into prayer with Him, He needs to purify you once more. And **His purification is to first show you your sins and trespasses, and then lead you to receive the cleansing of the blood. Under the precious blood you confess your sins one by one to God. You may confess for an hour and conclude with only five minutes of asking. You need to confess your sins thoroughly until you are without fear and are pure and light inside** . Then you can pray, saying, "O, God, the church has a problem here, the work has a difficulty here, etc. I place all these before You." (_Lessons on Prayer_, Chapter 13)

To be blended by the Lord, **we also need to confess all our defects, shortcomings, wrongdoings, mistakes, transgressions, trespasses, outward sins, and inward evils. We need not only to confess these things but also to ask for the Lord's forgiveness.** The New Testament is full of the promise of the Lord's forgiveness (Acts 2:38; 10:43; Eph. 1:7; Col. 1:14; 1 John 1:9). **The Lord is willing to forgive and even to forget (Heb. 8:12), but we need to confess. We should make a thorough confession so that we can be forgiven and justified. Then we can be blended** . (_Fellowship Concerning the Urgent Need of the Vital Groups_, Chapter 10)

**Hymns:**

_ **Hymn 280, ss. 1-2 & chorus** _

1Lord, may Thy blood now cleanse me,

Wash all my sins away,

That with Thy Holy Spirit

Thou may anoint, I pray.

My service, I confess, Lord,

Is failure-full and weak;

The filling of Thy Spirit

To live for Thee I seek.

Chorus

Oh, from myself deliver,

From all its misery;

I'd henceforth be forever

Completely filled with Thee.

2Oh, Lord, how dry my heart is,

It yearns and pants for Thee;

The filling of Thy Spirit

Is now my fervent plea.

Within the smitten Rock, Lord,

I would entirely hide;

Pour thru Thy living water,

Till I am satisfied.

_ **Hymn 1197** _

God is light, and in Him there is no darkness at all!

Oh, how we love within His presence to dwell!

In this light we enjoy a constant cleansing within—

From every sin!

Sisters: In the light,

Brothers: We are walking—

Sisters: Fellowship,

Brothers: We're enjoying;

Sisters: And the blood

Brothers: Of God's Son

Everyone: Is cleansing us from sin.

Sisters: We confess,

Brothers: He is faithful

Sisters: To forgive—

Brothers: He is righteous.

Sisters: What a joy!

Brothers: We are cleansed

Everyone: From every sin!
