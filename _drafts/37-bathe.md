**Scriptures** :

Exo. 30:18 **You shall also make a laver of bronze, with its base of bronze, for washing** . And you shall put it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and **you shall put water in it** .

1 Cor. 6:11 And these things were some of you; **but you were washed** , but you were sanctified, but you were justified **in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.**

Eph. 5:26 That He might **sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word** .

Titus 3:5 Not out of works in righteousness which we did but according to His mercy He saved us, through **the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit** .

**Footnotes:**

Exo 30:18, note 1 **The laver typifies the washing power of the life-giving Spirit issuing from the death of Christ** . The locating of the laver after the altar signifies that the washing power of the laver comes out of God's judgment at the altar. After passing through God's full judgment at the altar (the cross), **the crucified Christ entered into resurrection and became the life-giving Spirit who washes us** (1 Cor. 15:45; 6:11; Titus 3:5). The dimensions of the laver are not given, signifying that the life-giving Spirit is immeasurable, unlimited (John 3:34).

Exo 30:18, note 4 **The water put into the laver signifies the washing of the life-giving Spirit** . See Eph. 5:26 and notes.

Eph 5:26, note 2 (washing) Lit., laver. In Greek the definite article is used before this word, causing it to refer to the laver, the laver that was known to all the Jews. **In the Old Testament the priests used the laver to wash away their earthly defilement (Exo. 30:18-21). Now the laver, the washing of the water, washes us from defilement** .

Eph 5:26, note 3 (water) According to the divine concept, **water here refers to the flowing life of God, which is typified by flowing water** (Exo. 17:6; 1 Cor. 10:4; John 7:38-39; Rev. 21:6; 22:1, 17). The washing of the water here is different from the washing of the redeeming blood of Christ. The redeeming blood washes away our sins (1 John 1:7; Rev. 7:14), whereas **the water of life washes away the blemishes of the natural life of our old man, such as the "spot or wrinkle or any such things" mentioned in v. 27.** In separating and sanctifying the church, the Lord first washes away our sins with His blood (Heb. 13:12) and then washes away our natural blemishes with His life. **We are now in such a washing process,** that the church may be holy and without blemish (v. 27).

Eph 5:26, note 4 The Greek word denotes an instant word. **The indwelling Christ as the life-giving Spirit is always speaking an instant, present, living word to metabolically cleanse away the old and replace it with the new, causing an inward transformation. The cleansing by the washing of the water of life is in the word of Christ. This indicates that in the word of Christ there is the water of life. This is typified by the laver situated between the altar and the tabernacle (Exo. 38:8; 40:7** ).

**Ministry Excerpts:**

In the morning many saints spend time with the Lord. However, even though they spend a certain amount of time with Him, they may not absorb much of His riches. **The reason is that they are in too much of a hurry. If we would absorb the riches of Christ into us as our nourishment, we should not be rushed. We cannot absorb anything if we are in a hurry** (_How to Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God_, Chapter 5).

The Bible is not an ordinary book, for the word in the Bible is the embodiment of God, Christ, the Spirit, and life. This fact is proved in our experience. When we come to the Word, we sense that we come into the presence of God. As we read, we have a deep sense that we are in God. We never have the same sense when reading a secular magazine. **The more we read the Bible, the more we sense that we are bathingin the presence of God. The word refreshes, releases, soothes, and comforts us because it is the embodiment of God. In order to find God, we must come to the Bible. When we contact the word in the Bible, we touch God, for the word conveys God, Christ, the Spirit, and life** (_The Recovery of Christ as Everything in the Church_, Chapter 7).

We all know that the Bible is the word of God and that the word of God represents God Himself. Every time we come to the word of God, we should sense that we are touching God. Since we know that God is Spirit (John 4:24) and that we cannot contact Him with our mind, when we come to God, we should say, "O God, I love You. I come to read the Bible; I come to read Your word." Then perhaps when we open the Gospel of Matthew and come to Abraham, we may ask the Lord, "Who is Abraham?" **We may come across many things that we do not understand, but it does not matter if our mind does not understand. Inwardly we will still have the feeling that we have taken a sun bath or that we have been washed with water. Our entire inner being will be refreshed and soothed** .

Perhaps some people have had this kind of experience while others have not. As for myself, I have had many experiences like this. In the past when I read the Old Testament, in my mind I often could not understand, but the feeling in my spirit was that I had been washed in the word of God. These experiences were very fresh and soothing. Although I may not have understood the word, still after I read it, my inner being was refreshed. For example, one time I read Daniel 11 and was puzzled concerning the king of the south and the king of the north. **Nevertheless, since I had the right attitude—that the word I was reading was the speaking of my beloved Lord—my whole being was brought into the shining of His face, and I felt washed once again. Such a feeling was very fresh, very soothing, and very much a result of fellowship with the Lord. I did not know anything about the king of the south or the king of the north, but deep within my being I felt like I was bathing****  ****in God Himself. If we read the Bible in this way, we will sense God's "flavor"** (_The Path of Our Growth in Life_, Chapter 2).

**When we touch the Lord's Word with our spirit and remain in continual fellowship with Him, our spirit should have a feeling of being bathed, as if our whole being were taking a bath in the Bible.** This is refreshing, comfortable, and joyful. We should have this kind of feeling when we fellowship with God through reading the Word. If we do not have such a feeling, our fellowship with the Lord has ceased; otherwise, we would certainly have such a feeling. **When we pass through God's word, we should be like a person who has taken a bath, a person who has been soaked in water** .

Not only so, we should feel warm, as if we were sitting under the sun, and we should also be inwardly refreshed. The more we read, the more we should be refreshed. If we read for five minutes, we should be even more refreshed. Some may ask us to describe this freshness. Although it is difficult to fully describe this freshness, it is like the freshness of the morning dew. Consequently, we will also be moistened. We may not know what has touched us, what has enlightened us, or what we have learned, but we will be moistened. As we read verse by verse, we become moist and we will be full of an inward sweetness. In addition, we will sense a supply. The more we read, the more we will be inwardly satisfied, filled, empowered, and strengthened. There will also be light. But I am not stressing light because light implies understanding, and we have said that seeking to understand often becomes a hindrance to our fellowship.

**This is the way we should read the Bible for thirty minutes in the morning. Although we may not understand anything, we will take a bath in God's Word and feel warm in our spirit. We will not have the sense of being hot, scorched, or burned, but we will have an indescribably warm feeling and be refreshed, moistened, supplied, and satisfied. This is good Bible reading.** (_Lessons for New Believers_, Chapter 24).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 556, s.3** _

Bathe in His love, and of His fatness taste,

Lie on His breast, His sweetness there enjoy;

His love the banner, His affection shown

Tenderly soothes my heart to purest joy.

_ **Take Time to Absorb Him** _

1. Take time to receive Him—the blessing's outpoured,And we may obtain it by reading His Word;We bask in the splendour of His healing light,And light becomes life, as in Him we delight.

1. Take time to absorb Him, to gain the supply,That we may be watered and nourished thereby;The deeper the roots spread, the deeper the flow,And richer and higher within us He'll grow.

1. Take time to inhale Him—His Word we may breathe;By breathing it, God's very life we receive—He breathes Himself out so that we may breathe inThe life, the reality, fullness of Him.

1. Take time to enjoy Him, our portion is He:Our present, available reality;Our practical, real, and enjoyable LordIs everything to us through His living Word.

1. Take time to behold Him, gaze oft on His face,Receiving His Person, and grace upon grace.By His pleasant shining, infused we will be;Our faces will glow with His light, radiantly.

_ **Hymn 784, s. 6 & chorus** _

Pray to fellowship with Jesus,

Bathing in His countenance;

Saturated with His beauty,

Radiate His excellence.

Chorus

Pray to fellowship with Jesus,

In the spirit seek His face;

Ask and listen in His presence,

Waiting in the secret place.
