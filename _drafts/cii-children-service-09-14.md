The Work is beginning to require a background check for anyone participating in any overnight activities. The serving ones should also go through this to take care of any issues.

The service we're using is 'protectmyministry.(org?)'. What we've found is that if anyone has any kind of issue, they know about it and won't even go through the process. That in itself is a check.

Topics to cover:

1. What to do with our corporate getherings. The current model is falling apart.
2. Lesson-writing project
  . The goal is three years? How many lessons do we have? (Somewhere aroudn 148).
  . We probably should go back and fix some of them and cross-check. We do have some repetition (which is good).
  . Currently we have lessons through October; we need to write lessons for November and December.
  . (We began on 2/12/12)
  . Should we create lessons for all 30 character points or drop some?
    Genuine exact strict diligent broad fine stable patient deep pure just calm single corporate open affectionate ardent accomodating strong pliant submissive suffering lowly poor steadfast enduring bearing clear magnanimus grave.
      . Should we go through them again? It's been 3 years since we've covered them.
      . We should review / polish all of the lessons before we cover them.
      . The earlier lessons are a lot more spare in their applications.
3. Song booklets
  . Should we add new songs? Email sent to team with songs and words.
  . Idea is to create a new book with new songs and proposed deletions
  . Create a chorded version and version w/o chords
  . We can collect the older books and maybe donate them to other churches, or keep them for the small groups, etc.
  . We printed last time at (Kinkos?); we shoudl check with BOS systems (it's run by a brother?) in Anaheim; they do the books for the conferences. It may be cheaper.
  . We are proposing to remove 2 or three songs and double the number of total songs. (The fellowship was to keep them).
  . A many of the songs are newer songs Huong has heard from other places. We will need to put together some learning mp3s.
  . It would be good to have a group help index the songs.
  . We can add more songs. We should it by the 28th.
  . The church could make some copies available (have a kit for each district); extras would be purchased by the saints.
    . Some districts may not need / want them.
  4. Census
    . Include Name, gender, age/birthdays, parent's name/email, district, label it by 2014 (tab), category (indicate "New" family's kids). We should include grades.
    . The most accurate current list we have is from the Summer Bible camp registration.
      . It doesn't cover everybody and there were some from other (localities?)
    . When we had the young working saint's time, we had a list of their kids. Maybe someone can compile by district and then we could update. Would it be easier to just do a new one? Then the districts can do the work.
      . Should we create a Google doc? Don't ask the brothers; they are too busy.  go straight to the sisters.
      . This is a good time b/c it's a new school year.
      . The saints in the team should receive this google doc:

  5.Tom's Fellowship
    . We've written the lessons from a particular approach
      . Beginner:  Inspire
      . Intermediate: Begin to apply in an inspire and encourage.
      . Advanced:  Inspire, encourage, and use to prick their conscience and convict them a little bit. But some of the lessons don't require this.

      . When you get to "God as creator" there isn't a way to apply. God is love is easy - God is kind, we should love even those that don't like us. I wonder if next time around, if we can make a comment about these instead of contorting the lessons; I don't think we need to do much more than inspire the kids. They are facts. They don't really require an 'application'. For example, the lesson on Idolatry. There is only one God. I was pray-reading a verse this week on that. So on that lesson they talked about idolatry and brought up examples. It was too much and was destracting. Just tell them there is just one God. There are many religions, but there is only one God. There was one point on Jesus being God. That's great. It's good to say that God is the only God. That's good enough. But don't contort it, getting into what an idol is, covering examples... then we get off the point. 
      As we go these a second time, we should be able to pull some of these conclusions out. 
      . Also, many particular lessons also don't require application (like on God's creation, eg., talking about the sun). 
      . On the lessons on Perfect Humanity you want to find good applications and really touch them.
  6. ....
    . Should we remove the distinctions between levels? Some districts may not have that many kids, etc. No - instead, maybe we should put a note on the lessons with some further instruction.

  7. Might be good to have a time to review the burden...
  8. There are two perfecting times coming up - SCYP, and on the 28th, our local perfecting time for parents and serving ones.
    . Putting two on the church news may be confusing.
    . Historically, Irvine is not well represented in the SCYP (10/4) fellowship times.
      . We should encourage the saints at the local perfecting time on the 28th.
  9. Did we update the email list?
  10. Report about the trainees (Tom)
    . We have 5 Children's team trainees, under the care of teh full-timers.
      . The Francescos and _____ have identified themselves with some burden. I have been meeting with them about what to do.
      . We began by visiting families that have expressed some burden to do something in the past. We decided to start with the Quirogas and Felixes. 
      . As this progresses, our view is that we could begin neighborhood children's meetings that are not trainee-dependent; inestead they could be used to 'kickstart' the thing along with High Schoolers, college students. Then the trainees can widthdraw. If we can find a way for this to work, then it would be maintainable and have it continue during the interims. Then they could be free to help begin others.
      . The trainees are trained and are good with singing, telling stories... The thought is that they could also go out on Lord's day afternoons and visit families in the neighborhoods and invite other families. The meetings would be Friday afternoons. 
      . Some of the college and high school students may not be comfortable preaching the gospel on campus, but may be very much open to help with the children's meetings. These ones often are looking to get credit for activities they are involved in. 
      . Keep your eyes open and let us know if there are other families available and open.
      . Right now we are on a learning phase; we want this not to be burdensome but smooth. If we have a bad experience and it's tough and the mom's are burdened, that word will get out also and that would not be good.
      . We can adjust their schedule; we just need to make sure they have enought study time. In the past we have had meetings on Thursdays.
      . It would be good to let the saints know maybe in 2 weeks and see if there are other homes available and 'teed up'.
      . [some fellowship about the trainees]
      . Q: What type of approach are we taking - will we contact the families that are 'warm doors' or will they door knock?
        A: We don't know; we are open. Other localities are combining the children's team with the community team and going out on the gospel. My thought is that we would capitalize with the neighborhoods were we have children's meetings; these will be warm doors and also give the families some touch with the trainees and have them feel comfortable with them.
        . We had a young boy and a girl in our retreat this weekend who are just friends of our kids. He got save and baptized ut the mom is still an unbeliever.
        . There is another similar case where the kids come and we have never seen the parents. We want more of that.
  11. Sixth Grade gathering - Do we have to continue this? They are using material that is really old. I'm not sure. Mary Brown's friend has been coming to the Ferraro's home meeting. She has a son but the group doesn't have kids. Mary is burdened that the boy would be connected with some sixth graders. There aren't many. If we don't do a 6th grade thing, I feel we need to provide something (maybe the trainees can do something?)
        . Some started the program and did it after school for the whole year. Last year they may not have done it (they did; every other week starting in January).
        . It was a burdened mom's thing - in the principle of a neighborhood children's meeting. They started with 7 and ended with 11. There were kids getting saved and baptized and their parents are not in the church life that still come.
          . Can we find out how many we have and who's burdened? It would be great to do it again.
          . The old series of 6th grade lessons were all 'gospel lessons' (Starting wtih Genesis, God creating man, man's fall, Jesus coming, His life of redemption, regeneration, etc.). The point was to bring them to the point of salvation.
          . TOm: The reason we changed our approach was that we did not want to take the process to lead to salvation to turn into a curriculum. The realization of their own sinful condition and their need for God shoudl happen throughout their life; you can't postpone it until they are 6th grade. I am concerned that we would feel this is a program. Typically if we do the lessons as we planned/hoped, the serving ones are like mothers to the children, watching them and applying the lessons that along the way they are being inspired by them and encouraged. At some point we need to begin to press them concerning their living and life. At some point along the way they will realized that they cannot live up to that standard. As teachers you can watch that unfold before you. Then you will know they are ready to be saved. Then at that point, you can talk to them about sin, about the Lord's death, and lead them to salvation. If you talk about sin and these things before they are inwardly ready, it's just a Bible lesson. When we touch these matters of sin, salvation, the Lord's work on the cross - we don't want touch these as merely a Bible lesson. We are leading them on a 6 year gospel message. They shoudl get to a point when they realize they just can't do it or make it. When they get to that point, then you can lead them to salvation.
          . The older lessons, I see these as supplemental. It would be awesome to have burdened moms carry this burden out. It prepares them for Jr High. It would ge great to bring in High Schoolers to help with the burden.
          . What you don't want to do is bombard the kids with these points. Then they have heard the lessons over and over again, but they aren't touched. The new lessons are designed to get them to a crisis point. 'Premature knowledge' is to receive these points of truth before they have the realization they can't make it and the conviction of their sin. 
          . These points will be covered more on 10/4
12. Other items
  . Corporate time
    . We use to ahve each group sign up levels... some have districts have changed.
    . At Hall 3 districts 14, 15-16 provide...(?)
    . We now have a team of 6, with some young people. Some of these younger ones want to serve
    . in the past, D13 partnered with D14. D6 and D7 used to be one group with toddlers...
    . In the districting, the toddlers are with our children's meeting time.
    . The Toddler room seems too small, especially since many of the moms feel they need to stay with their kids.
      . We could do 5th and 6th (they were covering a separate curriculum)
      ...
      When we are at Hall 1:
        Opening - Try all kids together
        Who takes care of who:
