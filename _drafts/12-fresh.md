new

**Scriptures** :

Lev. 2:14 And if you present a meal offering of firstfruits to Jehovah, you shall present for the meal offering of your firstfruits new grain roasted with fire, **crushed grain of the fresh ear** .

S. S. 4:11 **Your lips drip fresh honey, my bride** ; / Honey and milk are under your tongue; / And the fragrance of your garments / Is like the fragrance of Lebanon.

Psa. 92:10 But You have exalted my horn like that of a wild ox; **/ I am anointed with fresh oil** .

Matt. 9:17 Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wineskins burst, and the wine pours out, and the wineskins are ruined; but **they put new wine into fresh wineskins** , and both are preserved.

2 Cor. 4:16 Therefore we do not lose heart; but though our outer man is decaying, yet **our inner man is being renewed day by day** .

2 Cor. 5:17 So then **if anyone is in Christ,**** he is a new creation**. The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new.

**Footnotes** :

Lev 2:14, note 1: **The meal offering of the firstfruits of new grain signifies the fresh enjoyment of Christ in His resurrection** (John 12:24; 1 Cor. 15:20). The crushing of the grains signifies being dealt with by the cross of Christ.

Lev 19:6, note 1: The word in vv. 6-8 signifies that **the believers' enjoyment of Christ as the peace offering for their fellowship with God and with one another should be kept fresh** . Stale fellowship with one another and with God is not acceptable but is abhorrent to God (v. 7). The one who participates in stale fellowship is guilty of having despised the holy things of God and will lose the fellowship among God's people (v. 8).

Psa 92:10, note 2 (anointed): Or, mingled; the same word is used in Lev. 2:4 (see note 3 there). **Another issue of our dwelling in God as our habitation is our being mingled with fresh oil, which signifies the consummated Spirit** (Exo. 30:23-25 and note 251), **who is fresh and present** .

2 Cor. 4:16, note 3: (renewed) **By being nourished with the fresh supply of the resurrection life** . As our mortal body, our outer man, is being consumed by the killing work of death, our inner man, that is, **our regenerated spirit with the inward parts of our being** (Jer. 31:33; Heb. 8:10; Rom. 7:22, 25) **,**** is being metabolically renewed day by day with the supply of the resurrection life**.

Rev 22:2, note 2: The fruits of the tree of life will be the food of God's redeemed for eternity. **They will be continually fresh,** being produced every month, twelve fruits yearly. That the tree of life bears twelve fruits means that the fruit of the tree of life is rich and is sufficient for the carrying out of God's eternal administration.

**Ministry Excerpts** :

**What is it to be fresh? To be fresh is to be vigorous and living. When you meet a saint with the appearance of oldness, you know that he has not been living in the Spirit. One who lives in the Spirit is renewed daily and never gets old** . A certain saint once testified that in 1933 he met an elderly Christian brother in Europe. This elderly brother was already over eighty years of age at that time and was not able to hear well. But when the saint fellowshipped with this brother, **he enjoyed his spiritual freshness** . According to his physical body, this elderly brother was not able to hear or speak much, but when people came to him, they could sense his inward freshness. This elderly man would hold the saint's hand steadily and firmly and say, "Brother, to this day I cannot live without Him, and He cannot live without me." Who is this "He"? This "He" is the Lord. How sweet a statement this is: "I cannot live without Him, and He cannot live without me." These two sentences are so fresh! This brother did not need to use thousands of words. Rather, in two sentences **he was able to cause others to touch God. This proves that he was inwardly living and fresh and had the presence of God** . (_Spiritual Reality_, Chapter 8)

**The Lord wants us to be fresh; He wants us to be fresh every day** . We may have been yellow yesterday, but we can be green again today. We may have been yellow this morning, but we can be green this afternoon. The Lord is fresh running water; He does not flow for five minutes and then stop. He flows continuously, daily, monthly, and yearly. There is not a minute in which He is short. **He is always fresh, and He is constantly refreshing us. This is the life that the Lord is leading us to live** . Here is power, joy, peace, and holiness. Only by living this way can we express the Lord's life. After the victory at Jericho, there is still the victory at Ai. After great victories, there are still small, daily victories. This should be our daily experience before the Lord.

The Bible says that Saul was taller than any of the people from his shoulders and upward (1 Sam. 10:23). Yet God was not pleased with his reign. Eventually, God did not choose him. Instead, He chose David to be the king. The Bible does not indicate David's height; **it merely says that he was ruddy and of a beautiful countenance (16:12). This implies freshness, like the freshness of a newborn baby whose face does not have any wrinkles; there is freshness and vitality. God wants our life to be fresh** . Psalm 1 says that the blessed man is one who is like a tree planted beside streams of water, yielding fruit in its season, and whose foliage does not wither (v. 3). We have leaves, which are our outward conduct. We may be patient, meek, humble, and perfect in our conduct and virtues. But the question is whether this conduct and virtues are green or whether they are wilting and yellow. Are they fresh, or are they old? Leaves denote our conduct. **If we are not under the fresh operation of the Holy Spirit, we will be doing the same things that we have done in the past. The result will surely not be green and fresh, but dry and old** . A person may have risen at five o'clock in the morning yesterday. He may do the same thing today. But yesterday he felt God's presence very near to him, yet today he does not touch Him at all. Outwardly, he is doing the same thing, but inwardly the feeling is gone. The inward freshness is gone because the leaves have dried up like the things in Noah's ark that belonged to the old creation. They are not like the fresh olive branch that appeared after the flood receded. Such people are of little use to the Lord. (_Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 42: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (2),_ Chapter 2, Section 4)

**A person who lives before the Lordâ€¦should be shining and fresh every day** . Whenever he comes to the Lord, he receives light. This is not the light that he saw yesterday but new light that he sees today. His inner being is always clear and certain about the direction of his serving and the move of the Holy Spirit. Not only does he know the direction of the move of the church, but he also knows God's purpose for the church on the earth. **His inner feeling is always fresh and bright. This kind of person is always learning something new and receiving new shining each day** . When people contact him, although outwardly he may not seem to be very affectionate, his inner being is soft and fresh, as clear as crystal, and transparent. Some who are saved, even having received grace from the Lord, would behave in a rough way; their problem is that their heart is not pure enough for the Lord. They are too complicated within, and so when a feeling comes, they are not willing to receive it. We all have the feeling within us, yet often we are not willing to receive the breaking that comes with the feeling. This unwillingness is the rejection of light. (_The Pure in Heart,_ Chapter 2, p.22)

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 743, s. 7** _

Keep our heart, Lord, in love's freshness,

And our spirit strengthen more,

That in newness of the spirit

We may touch Thee o'er and o'er.

_ **Hymn 365, ss. 1-3** _

1Jesus, Thy life is mine,

Dwell evermore in me;

And let me see

That nothing can untwine

Thy life from mine.

2Thy life in me be shown,

Lord, I would henceforth seek

To think and speak

Thy thoughts, Thy words alone,

No more my own.

3Thy love, Thy joy, Thy peace,

Continuously impart

Unto my heart,

Fresh springs that never cease,

But still increase.

_ **Hymn 782, s. 7** _

Lord, have mercy, from above

May Thy Spirit breathe on me;

Then my spirit will be rich,

Strengthened and refreshed by Thee.

_ **Hymn 211, s. 3** _

All that Thou hast Thou hast for me,

All my fresh springs are hid in Thee;

In Thee I live; while I confess

I nothing am, yet all possess.
