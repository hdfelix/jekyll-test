**Scriptures** :

Psa. 55:22 **Cast your burden upon Jehovah, / And He will sustain you** ; / He will never allow the righteous to be moved.

1 Pet. 5:7 **Casting all your anxiety on Him** because it matters to Him concerning you.

Job 5:8 But as for me, I would seek after God, / **And I would commit my cause to God** ,

Phil. 4:6 In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.

**Footnotes** :

1 Pet. 5:71 **[Casting] Or, throwing…upon; i.e., committing… to, giving up…to.** The tense of the verb indicates a once-for-all act.

1 Pet. 5:72 I.e., **the whole lot of your anxiety throughout your entire life** , the whole life with all its anxiety.

1 Pet. 5:73 Or, worry, care. The sufferings experienced by the believers in their persecution cause them to worry and be anxious. They need not only to be humbled, to be brought low from their pride, their haughtiness, but also to **throw their life with its care upon God** ; for He is not only mighty and just but also loving and faithful concerning them.

1 Pet. 5:74 Or, He cares for you. The disciplining and judging God has a loving concern for the believers, especially the persecuted ones. He cares for them faithfully. **They can throw their care on Him, especially in their persecution.**

**Ministry Excerpts** :

In Psalm 55…Verses 1-2, 4-8, 16-18a, 22, and 23b show us that the psalmist is seeking to experience God's salvation. Verse 22, a "golden" verse, says, " **Cast your burden upon Jehovah,/And He will support you;/** He will never allow the righteous to be moved." This verse assures us that with God we are safe, for He, the supporting One, will not allow anything to move us. **Do you have any kind of burden, and are you still bearing it by yourself? You need to cast your burden upon Jehovah, and He will support you** . (Life-study of Psalms, Ch. 24, Section 5)

There are many verses in the Bible which are precious promises of God to us. In Matthew 6 the Lord promises us that we don't need to be anxious for food, drink, or clothing. The Father knows what we need. **Then 1 Peter 5:7 says, "Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you." He indwells us and bears all our cares. He not only bears our burdens, He even bears us** . Therefore, why should we worry? We cannot add one inch to our height by worrying. We must fully give ourselves over to Him. I realize that to say this is easy, but to put it into practice is much more difficult. When we try to rejoice, after we shout three times, we start worrying. We hardly have any faith at all. Then what shall we do? We must forget about ourselves and turn to Him. Let the Lord live for you. Let Him bear all the burden. **Cast all your cares upon Him, for He cares for you** . Since He cares for us, we don't need to care. I realize that regardless of what I say, you will still care very much **. But you have a Person within you. Turn to Him and let Him bear all your burdens** . (The Indwelling Christ in the Canon of the New Testament, Ch. 15, Section 4)

**The word casting here [in verse 7] means throwing upon, that is, committing to, giving up to. The verb denotes a once-for-all act.** The words "all your anxiety" indicate that the whole lot of our anxiety throughout our entire life, our whole life with all its anxiety, should be cast on the Lord. **We need to learn how to throw the burden of our anxiety upon God. It may now be on our own shoulder, but we should cast it from our shoulder to God. Although the verb "casting" indicates a once-for-all act, because we are weak, we may need to cast our anxieties upon God again and again.** Sometimes we cast our anxieties upon Him only to secretly take them back a while later. This has been my experience. I may cast my anxiety upon the Lord. But a few days later I may realize that I have taken this anxiety back upon myself, and therefore I need to pray, "O Lord, forgive me for taking this anxiety back from You. Once again, I would cast my anxieties upon You." (Life-Study of 1 Peter, Chapter 33, Section 3)

**He has invited us to come before Him and cast our anxieties on Him** . God is a God who bears our anxiety. He beckons us to lay our anxiety on Him. To Him this is no hardship. Isaiah 53:4 said that the Lord Jesus has "borne our sicknesses and carried our sorrows…" If you worry about your immediate problems, the break up of your family, the moral degradation of your children and their waywardness from the Lord, the failure of your business, the frictions between in-laws, the salvation of others, or the backward and fallen spiritual condition of God's children, **you should realize that God wants you to cast your anxiety on Him. In the midst of all these problems, God is asking you to come to Him. God is asking you to come not with your good things, but with your anxieties and worries. He will bear your anxieties** . All of you who have a broken heart, a heavy heart, and a pained heart, come unto God! Today you need not be anxious anymore! This is the gospel. (Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 18: Notes on Scriptural Messages (2), Chapter 4, Section 3)

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 661** _

1. Master, how shall I bless Thy nameFor love so great to me,For sweet enablings of Thy grace,So sov'reign, yet so free,That taught me to obey Thy word,And cast my care on Thee?
2. No anxious thought upon thy browThe watching world should see;No carefulness! O child of God,For nothing careful be!But cast thou all thy care on HimWho always cares for thee.
3. How shall I praise Thee, Savior dear,For this new life so sweet,For taking all the care I laidAt Thy beloved feet,Keeping Thy hand upon my heartTo still each anxious beat?
4. I long to praise Thee more, and yetThis is no care to me;If Thou shalt fill my mouth with songsThen I shall sing to Thee;And if my silence praise Thee best,Then silent I will be.
5. Yet if it be Thy will, dear Lord,Oh, send me forth to beThy messenger to careful hearts,To bid them taste, and seeHow good Thou art to those who castAll all their care on Thee.

_ **Hymn 696** _

1. Cast thou thy care upon the Lord,The care that loads thy heart;Take Him this moment at His word,And let Him do His part.
2. The need is deep, the care is great,The burden hard to bear;Roll it on Him with all its weight,And leave it resting there.
3. This heavy thing, it is His gift,His portion, thee to bless;Give it Him back; what He shall liftNo more on thee shall press.

1. Cast all thy care, and not a part,The great things and the small;The Lord's all-loving, mighty heartHas room and thought for all.
2. Yes, He will ponder every care,Consider each detail;Thyself, thy burden, let Him bear;He will not, cannot, fail.

_ **Hymn 697** _

1. Weary pilgrim on life's pathway—Struggling on beneath thy load—Hear these words of consolation,"Cast thy burden on the Lord."

Cast thy burden on the Lord!  
Cast thy burden on the Lord,  
And He will strengthen thee,  
sustain and comfort thee—  
Cast thy burden on the Lord.

1. Are thy tired feet unsteady?Does thy lamp no light afford?Is thy cross too great and heavy?"Cast thy burden on the Lord."
2. Are the ties of friendship severed?Hushed the voices fondly heard?Breaks thy heart with weight of anguish?"Cast thy burden on the Lord."
3. Does thy heart with faintness falter?Does thy mind forget His word?Does thy strength succumb to weakness?"Cast thy burden on the Lord."
4. He will hold thee up from falling;He will guide thy steps aright;He will strengthen each endeavor;He will keep thee by His might.
