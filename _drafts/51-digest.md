**Scriptures** :

Ezek. 2:8 But you, son of man, hear what I say to you; do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. **Open your mouth and eat what I give you.**

Ezek. 3:1 Then He said to me, Son of man, eat what you find; eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel. 2 So I opened my mouth, and He gave me that scroll to eat. 3 And He said to me, **Son of man, feed your stomach and fill your inward parts with this scroll that I am giving you** . And I ate it, and it was like honey in my mouth in its sweetness.

John 6:35 Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst. 54 He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day. 55 For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink. 56 He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me and I in him. :57 As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, **so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me** .

Rev. 10:9 And I went to the Angel and told Him to give me the little scroll. And He said to me, Take it and devour it, and it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey. 10 And I took the little scroll out of the hand of the Angel and devoured it, and **it was as sweet as honey in my mouth; and when I had eaten it, my stomach became bitter.**

**Footnotes** :

Exo 16:321 The open manna, the manna that lay on the ground every morning, was for the enjoyment of God's people in a public way. However, the omer of manna placed in a pot (v. 33) was hidden and was not for the congregation in a public way. The amount of manna kept in a pot before Jehovah was one omer, the same as the amount gathered and eaten by the people (vv. 16-18). **In spiritual experience, this indicates that the amount of Christ we eat is the amount we can preserve. The Christ whom we eat as open manna spontaneously becomes hidden manna by being digested and assimilated into our inner being.** Furthermore, whatever we eat of Christ will become a memorial in generations to come. The Christ whom we eat and enjoy will be an eternal memorial, **because such a Christ becomes our very constitution, enabling us to build up and even to become God's dwelling place in the universe.**

John 6:571 (eats) **To eat is to take food into us that it may be assimilated organically into our body. Hence, to eat the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into us that He may be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life. Then we live by Him whom we have received** . It is by this that He, the resurrected One, lives in us (14:19-20).

Rev 10:102 When we receive the divine revelation by devouring it, it is sweet as we eat it, **but it becomes bitter as we digest it, that is, as we experience it.**

**Ministry Excerpts** :

In the morning many saints spend time with the Lord. However, **even though they spend a certain amount of time with Him, they may not absorb much of His riches.** The reason is that they are in too much of a hurry. If we would absorb the riches of Christ into us as our nourishment, we should not be rushed. **We cannot absorb anything if we are in a hurry** .

We should not only absorb the Lord in the morning, but we should be like trees continually absorbing the riches of the soil. **This means that we must learn to practice the continual enjoyment of Christ** . We should let every physical thing be a reminder of Christ, for all these things are shadows of which Christ is the substance. The clothing we put on each day should remind us of Christ. We should put Him on in our spirit and by our spirit. Drinking a glass of water should remind us to drink Christ by the exercise of our spirit. **To follow this practice is to be rooted in Christ and to absorb His riches** (_Life-Study of Colossians,_ Chapter 55).

As we have pointed out, God is not simply a term nor an object of worship. He is real, rich, and substantial, **and we need to absorb Him. Our God today is the processed, all-inclusive Spirit, and we have a spirit with which to absorb Him** . Thus, we must exercise our spirit to stay in His presence to absorb Him. This takes time. Although we all have experienced absorbing the riches of God, our experience is not yet adequate. **For this reason, we must spend more time to absorb Him** . Do not spend so much time in your mind, emotion, and will, **but spend more time in your spirit to adore the Lord, to praise Him, to offer thanks to Him, and to speak to Him freely. As you fellowship with Him in this way, you will absorb His riches, and He will add more of Himself into you** . The more God is added into us, the more growth He gives to us. This is the way God gives the growth. (_Life-Study of Colossians,_ Chapter 52).

Stanza 3 of _Hymns,_ #509 says, "The river does the Spirit show, / Coming man's spirit to supply, / That with God's riches he be filled, / Holy to be thereby." **The enjoyment of God's riches makes us holy. After we eat food, we assimilate it, and whatever we assimilate saturates us and changes us. Likewise, when we take God as food into us, we assimilate Him as our nourishment, and His substance and element become our "ingredients."** It is in this way that we are made holy, that is, sanctified by God and with God as holiness. The way to be sanctified is by taking the Lord as our nourishment. **When we feed on Him and drink of Him, we assimilate Him and are sanctified** (_The Divine Spirit with the Human Spirit in the Epistles,_ Chapter 9).

When we study the Word, we should not look for teachings, just as when we pray, we should not ask for many things. **The purpose of our prayer is to breathe in God. Similarly, the purpose of our reading the Bible is to assimilate God. The subject and the center of prayer is God Himself.** The subject and the center of reading the Word should also be God Himself. Just as we breathe ourselves out and breathe in God through prayer, we deny ourselves and receive all that God is through reading the Word. The real reading of the Word has nothing to do with acquiring teaching in the mind. Rather, it is a fresh assimilation of God in the spirit (_How to Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God,_ Chapter 6).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 612, ss. 1-4** _

1God intends that all His being

Be my full supply;

With Him I must be united,

In spirit nigh.

Chorus

All God's being, all His riches

In the Spirit flow;

I must exercise my spirit

Him to know.

2All the riches of His nature

He has given me;

I must touch Him in the spirit,

These to see.

3With the mind we understand Him,

With the spirit touch;

Those who never use the spirit

Lack very much.

4When to messages I listen,

I must pray them in;

Thus the word will be digested

From within.

_ **Hymn 1147, ss. 1, 9, 11** _

1. Christ is our manna true,

Our bread of life indeed;

He's our supply of nourishment,

As on Him now we feed.

9How pure and white and clean;

In type our Christ we see;

As we digest His element,

He washes inwardly.

1. By eating more of Christ

We'll be the less opaque;

We'll then appear as bdellium,

Transparent us to make.

_ **Hymn 509, ss. 1-4** _

1A flowing river and a tree,

Eden's outstanding features are,

Man to supply with food and drink

That he may live fore'er.

Chorus:

God is in Christ to be my supply,

God as the Spirit nourisheth me;

If upon Christ in spirit I feed,

Filled with His life I'll be.

2The tree the glorious Christ does show,

As living food to man supplied,

That he God's riches may enjoy,

Thus to be satisfied.

3The river does the Spirit show,

Coming man's spirit to supply,

That with God's riches he be filled,

Holy to be thereby.

4The Christ of glory is my life,

He as the Spirit lives in mine,

That I with God be fully blent

And in His image shine.

_ **Take Time to Absorb Him, ss. 2-4** _

1. Take time to absorb Him, to gain the supply,That we may be watered and nourished thereby;The deeper the roots spread, the deeper the flow,And richer and higher within us He'll grow.

1. Take time to inhale Him—His Word we may breathe;By breathing it, God's very life we receive—He breathes Himself out so that we may breathe inThe life, the reality, fullness of Him.

1. Take time to enjoy Him, our portion is He:Our present, available reality;Our practical, real, and enjoyable LordIs everything to us through His living Word.
