**Scriptures** :

Deut. 4:10 Especially do not forget the day when you stood before Jehovah your God at Horeb, when Jehovah said to me, **Gather the people to Me, and I will let them hear My words, so that they may learn to fear Me all the days that they live upon the earth** and may teach their children as much.

Isa. 26:9 My soul desires You in the night; / Indeed my spirit within me seeks You at the dawn; / **For when Your judgments are in the earth, / The inhabitants of the world learn righteousness** .

Matt. 11:29 **Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me** , for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.

Eph. 4:20 **But you did not so learn Christ, 21 If indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him as the reality is in Jesus.**

**Footnotes** :

Eph 4:201 (learn) Christ is not only life to us but also an example (John 13:15; 1 Pet. 2:21). In His life on earth He set up a pattern, as revealed in the Gospels. Then He was crucified and resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit that He might enter into us to be our life. **We learn from Him (Matt. 11:29) according to His example, not by our natural life but by Him as our life in resurrection. To learn Christ is simply to be molded into the pattern of Christ, that is, to be conformed to the image of Christ** (Rom. 8:29).

Eph 4:211 The reality is in Jesus refers to the actual condition of the life of Jesus as recorded in the four Gospels. In the godless walk of the nations, the fallen people, there is vanity. But in the godly life of Jesus there is truth, reality. Jesus lived a life in which He did everything in God, with God, and for God. God was in His living, and He was one with God. This is what is meant by the reality is in Jesus. **We, the believers, who are regenerated with Christ as our life and are taught in Him, learn from Him as the reality is in Jesus** .

**Ministry Excerpts** :

Ephesians 4:20 says, "But you did not so learn Christ." We must pay attention to the phrase _learn Christ_ and understand it in the proper way. To learn Christ does not mean that because Christ loved people, we also should love people. When I was a child, I was taught that because Jesus loved poor people, we must love poor people as well. I was wrongly taught that such imitation is what it means to learn Christ. **To learn Christ does not mean that we imitate Him; it means that we, within whom Christ dwells, have Christ as our life in everything that we do. It means that when we think about things, we take Christ as our life subjectively and live Him out. Learning Christ is not objective—it is not simply taking the Christ who is outside of us and following His example. Rather, learning Christ is very subjective. It has everything to do with Christ being in us, dwelling in us, and being life to us. For us to learn Christ means that His mind becomes our mind, His love becomes our love, and His heart becomes our heart** . We must take His mind as our mind and therefore give up our own mind. This is the right way to learn Christ. In the next verse, Paul says "If indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him as the reality is in Jesus" (v. 21). All the reality that is in Christ must be enjoyed by us and must become our portion. For example, love and light are realities. These realities are in Christ. Since we have been regenerated, Christ is in us. Therefore, whatever He has within Himself—in this example, love and light—has become our portion (_The Believer's Experience of Transformation,_ Chapter 4).

**The basic elements in the learning of Christ are reality and grace. In contrast to the Gospel of John where grace precedes reality, in Ephesians 4 before Paul mentions grace, that is, the supply, he presents the reality, that is, the principle, the pattern, and the standard. The reality is the shining of light; as members of the Body of Christ under the Head, we should learn Christ as the reality is in Jesus. Yet in order to live out this standard of the reality, we must have grace** . In verse 29 Paul relates grace to our speaking. This indicates that we need grace for the details of our daily life, not merely for what we regard as important matters. We may have grace in big matters but not in small matters. For instance, in our daily conversation we may be devoid of grace. In no area of our daily life do we require grace more than in our conversation. If we have grace in this aspect of our living, we will have grace in every other aspect. In all things we need grace to live a life according to the reality that is in Jesus. Grace is our rich supply and enjoyment. If we have this supply and enjoyment, we will be able to live according to the standard of the reality (_Conclusion of the New Testament, The (Msgs. 323-345),_ Chapter 19).

**The fourth principle is that we need to learn Christ as the truth is in Jesus (Eph. 4:20-21)** . The Bible is not a book of vain teaching. It teaches us something real. In particular, it teaches us a person, Jesus Christ, who is divine as well as human. He is the complete God and the perfect man. In Him we can see the wonderful, excellent, divine attributes, such as the divine love, light, and patience, lived out through the human virtues. **We need to learn of this reality** . Jesus is humble, kind, and patient. This is the truth in Jesus. To have the truth that is in Jesus is just to have God the Father as the reality living through our own humanity. Our love is like a glove, and Christ's love is like the hand. Without the hand, the glove is empty and has no reality. But when the hand with the fingers enters into and fills the glove, the glove is filled with reality (_The Economy and Dispensing of God,_ Chapter 10).

Christ is not only life to us but also an example (John 13:15; 1 Pet. 2:21). In His life on earth He set up a pattern, as revealed in the Gospels. Then He was crucified and resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit that He might enter into us to be our life. We learn from Him (Matt. 11:29) according to His example, not by our natural life but by Him as our life in resurrection. **To learn Christ is simply to be molded into the pattern of Christ, that is, to be conformed to the image of Christ (Rom. 8:29)** . The expression _the reality is in Jesus_ refers to the actual condition of the life of Jesus as recorded in the four Gospels. In the godless walk of the nations, the fallen people, there is vanity, but in the godly life of Jesus there is the reality. Jesus lived a life in which He did everything in God, with God, and for God. God was in His living, and He was one with God. This is what is meant by _the reality is in Jesus._ **We, the believers, who are regenerated with Christ as our life and are taught in Him, learn from Him as the reality is in Jesus** (_Conclusion of the New Testament, The (Msgs. 323-345),_ Chapter 19).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 87** _

1O Lord! When we the path retrace

Which Thou on earth hast trod,

To men Thy wondrous love and grace,

Thy faithfulness to God;

2Thy love, by man so sorely tried,

Proved stronger than the grave;

The very spear that pierced Thy side

Drew forth the blood to save;

3Though Thou didst pass through woes and grief,

Thy works were ever good;

Although midst sorrows all Thy life,

Thou spak'st no murmuring word.

4Faithful amidst unfaithfulness,

'Mid darkness only light,

Thou didst Thy Father's name confess,

And in His will delight;

5Unmoved by Satan's subtle wiles,

Or suffering, shame, and loss,

Thy path, uncheered by earthly smiles,

Led only to the cross.

6We wonder at Thy lowly mind,

And fain would like Thee be,

And all our rest and pleasure find

In learning, Lord, of Thee.

_ **Hymn 355** _

1O blessed, living Lord,

Engage our hearts with Thee,

And strike within some answ'ring chord

To love so rich and free!

2To know Thy loving heart!

To cleave to Thy blest side!

To gaze upon Thee where Thou art,

And in Thy love abide!

3To walk with Thee below!

To learn Thy holy ways!

And more to Thine own stature grow,

To Thine eternal praise!

4Thyself our one Desire!

Thyself our Object here!

The goal to which our hearts aspire—

To meet Thee in the air!

_ **Hymn 382** _

1More about Jesus would I know,

More of His grace to others show;

More of His saving fulness see,

More of His love who died for me.

More, more about Jesus,

More, more about Jesus;

More of His saving fulness see,

More of His love who died for me.

2More about Jesus let me learn,

More of His holy will discern;

Spirit of God my teacher be,

Showing the things of Christ to me.

3More about Jesus; in His Word,

Holding communion with my Lord;

Hearing His voice in every line,

Making each faithful saying mine.

4More about Jesus; on His throne,

Riches in glory all His own;

More of His kingdom's sure increase;

More of His coming, Prince of Peace.
