long, hunger, thirst, pant

**Scriptures** :

Psa. 42:1 As the hart pants / After the streams of water, / So **my soul pants / For You, O God** . 2 **My soul thirsts for God** , / For the living God. / When will I come and appear / Before God?

Psa. 63:1 O God, You are my God; I seek You diligently. / **My soul thirsts for You** , / My flesh faints in longing for You, / In a dry and weary land without water.

Psa. 73:25 Whom do I have in heaven but You? / And **besides You there is nothing I desire on earth** .

Psa. 84:2 **My soul longs, indeed even faints, / For the courts of Jehovah** ; / My heart and my flesh cry out / To the living God.

Psa. 119:131 **I opened my mouth wide and panted** , / For I longed for Your commandments.

Isa. 26:8 Indeed in the path of Your judgments, / O Jehovah, we have waited for You. / **Your name,** that is, Your memorial, **/ Is the desire of our soul.**

Isa. 26:9 **My soul desires You in the night** ; / Indeed my spirit within me seeks You at the dawn; / For when Your judgments are in the earth, / The inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.

Matt. 5:6 Blessed are those who **hunger and thirst for righteousness** , for they shall be satisfied.

**Footnotes** :

Psa 42:1, note 2 (pants) In this psalm the psalmist was panting and thirsting (v. 2) for God at a time when he and his people had been stripped and defeated by the neighboring nations and were in captivity (see note 61). Panting and thirsting for God are different from worshipping God in a formal, religious way. **God is our living water for us to drink (John 4:10, 14; 7:37-39a; 1 Cor. 12:13). We need to pant and thirst for Him and to drink Him** .

Psa 43:4, note 1 The psalmists who wrote Psa. 42—44 were lovers of God in their captivity (42:6). **They were panting for God, thirsting for God (42:1-2), and desiring to return to Jerusalem, to go to Mount Zion to reach the altar** . **Then they could enter into the temple to meet God their exceeding joy** . This is why they prayed that God would give them the light and the truth (v. 3) that they might know how to be released from their captivity and return to God's dwelling place.

**Ministry Excerpts** :

**The reason that God renews our heart and gives us a new heart at the time of our regeneration is that He wants us to incline toward Him, adore Him, desire Him, and love Him** . Before, we did not love Him and we could not love Him, because our heart was old and hard. Now He has renewed, softened, and turned our heart; thus, we are both able and willing to love Him. Since our heart by being renewed has become a new heart, it now has a new function. This new function is that it can incline toward God and love God and the things of God. **Since regeneration gives us a new heart, it causes us to have a new inclination and love, a new desire and longing. This new inclination, love, desire, and longing are all toward God and the things of God.** This is the function of the new heart; this is also the purpose of God in giving us a new heart (_The Knowledge of Life,_ Chapter 4).

According to the Word of God and the experience of many saints, the first thing the Holy Spirit does within a person (which is the same work He does within everyone) is to **create a longing heart in him** . **All spiritual progress begins when God initiates a good work in a person through the Holy Spirit by creating a longing within** . Every time there is any spiritual progress, the Holy Spirit has initiated it. The Holy Spirit makes us feel dissatisfied with our present condition; the Holy Spirit makes us feel that our present condition is wrong and that our spiritual life is too shallow. The first work of the Holy Spirit is to give us a sense of dissatisfaction and to create in us a desire to be better. Brothers and sisters, **if we want to have any spiritual progress, we must first become dissatisfied with our present spiritual condition, and we must seek for something better. This is the beginning of spiritual progress** . Putting it another way, all failure and decadence is the result of self-complacency. The beginning of failure is self-complacency. Our feelings of dissatisfaction with ourselves indicates the Holy Spirit has begun His work in us and that is the time for us to go forward. Whenever we are ignorant of our poverty and deficiency, we have come to a standstill. Decadence comes from self-complacency, whereas **progress comes from hunger** (_Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 37: General Messages (1),_ Chapter 23).

**This inward urge is the beginning of all progress** . **Spiritual edification can never be separated from a pursuit that is based on hunger and thirst** . If the Holy Spirit has not put a real dissatisfaction with a general relationship and a pursuit for personal affection within a believer, he can never expect to have an intimate experience of the Lord. This pursuit is the basis for all future experience. If we do not have such a hunger and thirst, we will only have a poetic song, and it will not be the Song of Songs (_The Song of Songs, _Chapter 1).

It is very striking that Book Two begins with the psalmist's panting after God. Panting after God is different from worshipping God in a formal, religious way. God is our living water for us to drink. Do we need to bow down to worship the water? **We need to pant after this water and then drink it. In verse 1 the word pants is used. In verse 2 the word thirsts is used. My soul pants for God and thirsts for God. I love these predicates. We need to have times with the Lord in which we pant after Him and thirst for Him** (_Life-Study of Psalms, _Chapter 19).

**Hymns** :

_ **Mary poured out her love offering, ss. 1-3** _

1Mary poured out her love offering

To many such love was a waste.

Throughout all of the centuries

Such lovers Your sweetness do taste.

Precious lives and heart treasures, too

Positions and golden futures,

Have been "wasted" on You, Lord;

Your sweetness a fragrance so sure.

She took opportunity

To love You; Lord, with her best.

Like her, Lord, I too would pour

My love and all that I have.

2As I love You I set my being—

My spirit, my soul and body.

With my heart, my mind, and my strength,

Absolutely on Thee.

Lord, I let my entire being

Be occupied by Thee

As I enter in Your heart

I sense a fellowship sweet.

Occupied and lost in You;

My Lord, You're my everything.

Fellowship so intimate;

In spirit Lord I enjoy Thee.

3Lord there's none in heav'n nor on earth

That I desire but Thee.

Though my heart and flesh faileth, Lord,

Thou ever my portion will be.

All is vanity, all is dung;

I count all other things loss;

Everything else drains my love

But You have captured my heart.

Lord, I've seen Thy preciousness,

Thy worth, Thy reality.

Now, my Lord, I must confess

My heart is only for Thee.

_ **Hymn 811, ss. 1, 2, 6, 8** _

1My heart is hungry, my spirit doth thirst;

I come to Thee, Lord, to seek Thy supply;

All that I need is none other but Thee,

Thou canst my hunger and thirst satisfy.

Chorus

Feed me, Lord Jesus, give me to drink,

Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst;

Flood me with joy, be the strength of my life,

Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst.

2Thou art the food and the water of life,

Thou canst revive me, my spirit upbear;

I long to eat and to drink here of Thee,

Thyself enjoy through my reading and prayer.

6Now to enjoy Thee I come to Thy Word,

On Thee to feed till my hunger is o'er.

Now in my spirit I turn unto Thee,

Of Thee to drink till I'm thirsty no more.

8Here, O my Lord, may I feast upon Thee;

Flood with Thy Spirit and fill by Thy Word;

May, Lord, Thou be such a feast unto me

As man hath never enjoyed nor e'er heard.

_ **Hymn 349, ss. 1, 3** _

1As pants the hart for cooling streams

When heated in the chase,

So longs my soul, O God, for Thee,

And Thy refreshing grace.

3For Thee, my God, the living God,

My thirsty soul doth pine;

Oh, when shall I behold Thy face,

Thou Majesty Divine?
