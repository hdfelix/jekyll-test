**Scriptures** :

S. S. 1:4b The king has **brought me into**** his chambers**— / We will be glad and rejoice in you; / We will extol your love more than wine. / Rightly do they love you.

2 Tim. 4:22 **The Lord be with your spirit** . Grace be with you.

Heb. 10:19 Having therefore, brothers, **boldness for entering the Holy of Holies** in the blood of Jesus.

John 4:24 God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must **worship in spirit** and truthfulness.

Eph. 6:18 By means of all prayer and petition, **praying at every time in spirit** and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints

**Footnotes** :

S.S. 1:4, note 2 **In her pursuing of Christ the seeker is brought by Him into her regenerated spirit as the Holiest of all (his chambers) to have fellowship with Him** (2 Cor. 13:14; Phil. 2:1). Our regenerated spirit (John 3:6) as Christ's dwelling place, which is mingled with and indwelt by Christ as the life-dispensing Spirit (1 Cor. 6:17; 2 Tim. 4:22), becomes His inner chambers, His practical Holy of Holies (Heb. 4:16; 10:19), for our participation in and enjoyment of Him as the consummated Triune God.

Through His death and resurrection Christ, as the last Adam, a man in the flesh, became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17). **As the all-inclusive consummated Spirit He visits us in our spirit privately, coming to us in a spiritual way, not in a physical way** .

Heb 10:19, note 1 The Holy of Holies today is in heaven, where the Lord Jesus is (9:12, 24). **How, then, can we enter the Holy of Holies while we are still on earth? The secret is our spirit, referred to in 4:12** . The very Christ who is in heaven is now also in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). As the heavenly ladder (Gen. 28:12; John 1:51), He joins our spirit to heaven and brings heaven into our spirit. Hence, **whenever we turn to our spirit, we enter into the Holy of Holies. There we meet with God, who is on the throne of grace.** See note 161 in ch. 4.

1 Cor. 2:15, note 1 **A spiritual man is one who denies his soul and does not live by his soul but allows his spirit, that is, his regenerated spirit, which is occupied and energized by the Spirit of God, to dominate his entire being** . Furthermore, he lives by such a spirit, moving and acting according to it (Rom. 8:4). Such a spiritual person is able to discern the things of the Spirit of God because his constitutional capacity for spiritual perception is able to manifest its function.

Rom 2:29, note 2 I.e., based on. Whatever we are, whatever we do, and whatever we have must be in spirit. This will keep us from the vanity of religion. See note 92 in ch. 1. **The reality of all spiritual things depends on the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God is in our spirit. Hence, the reality of all spiritual matters depends on our spirit,** not on anything apart from our spirit. Whatever is in us is vanity unless it is in our spirit. **Everything that God is to us is in our spirit.**

**Ministry Excerpts** :

In this message we want to stress the words _private_ and _spiritual_. Christianity preaches the physical Jesus, but we preach the pneumatic Christ, the Christ who is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). This One is private and spiritual. **We have seen that the king's chambers signify our spirit. He visits us in our spirit privately, and He comes to us in a spiritual way, not a physical way** . He visits us privately as the all-inclusive, consummated Spirit.

Christ the King brings His seekers into His chambers, that is, into their regenerated spirit, His dwelling place. Let us consider the application of this. When I was young, I was taught to pray to God as the heavenly Father. I was also told not to pray to the Spirit, because in the entire New Testament you cannot find a verse concerning praying to the Spirit. But the more we pray, the more we have the feeling that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all in us (Eph. 4:6; 2 Cor. 13:5; Rom. 8:9). **According to our experience, our spirit is the Holy of Holies—the dwelling place, the inner chambers, of the Triune God** . In this first chapter of Song of Songs He and we have the private and affectionate fellowship.

The seeker in Song of Songs prayed, "Draw me; we will run after you." Then the king drew her and she followed, but she did not know where to go. The King knows where to go. **We must go to our spirit. The inner chambers of Christ are His lovers' regenerated spirits mingled with and indwelt by Him as the life-dispensing Spirit (Rom. 8:16; 2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:11) and are the practical Holy of Holies in Christ's lovers for their participation in and enjoyment of the pneumatic Christ as the consummated Triune God** (Heb. 4:16).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 769, ss. 1-7** _

1To the holiest place I'd come,

There within the veil to be;

There to touch the throne of grace,

Let life's water flow thru me.

2Now the holiest place of all

Right within my spirit is;

Here the Lord in me abides,

And my spirit joins with His.

3To my spirit I'd return,

For 'tis here the Lord I'll meet;

O how marvellous it is!

He's within, in me complete.

4Fragrance of the risen Christ

Thru my spirit may be spread;

If in spirit I will pray

Christ will be exhibited.

5If in spirit Him I touch,

With His riches filled I'll be;

Life and light and love and grace

As a stream will flow thru me.

6Touching deeply, richly I

Of Himself experience,

Thus the law of life I touch

And His clear anointing sense.

7In my spirit deeper still

I would touch the Lord I love,

Touch Him in His hidden depth

And His hidden manna prove.

_ **Hymn 745** _

1O Lord, Thou art the Spirit now

Who in our spirit lives;

One spirit have the two become,

Which oneness to us gives.

2Thy Spirit with our spirit, Lord,

The witness ever bears

That we the Father's children are

And of God's glory heirs.

3'Tis in our spirit Thee we touch

Thy riches to enjoy,

And as the Spirit Thou dost give

Thyself without alloy.

4'Tis in our spirit we may walk

And follow Thee alway,

While, as the Spirit, Thou dost lead

And light impart each day.

5In spirit, by Thy Spirit, Lord,

We live and worship Thee;

Thou, in our spirit, thru Thine own

Strengtheneth constantly.

6In spirit, with Thy Spirit, Lord,

We offer prayer to Thee,

While, as the Spirit, Thou in us

Groanest unutterably.

7We to our spirit would return

And there would contact Thine;

'Tis in the spirit we may share

Our heritage divine.

8What oneness, O my Lord, is this-

Two spirits intertwine!

Thy Spirit in our spirit lives,

And ours abides in Thine!
