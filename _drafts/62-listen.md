hear

**Scriptures** :

Psa. 143:8 **Cause me to hear Your lovingkindness in the morning** , / For in You I trust. / Make known to me the way on which I should walk, / For to You I lift up my soul.

Isa. 50:4 The Lord Jehovah has given me / The tongue of the instructed, / That I should know how to sustain the weary with a word. / He awakens me morning by morning; / **He awakens my ear / To hear as an instructed one. 5 The Lord Jehovah has opened my ear; / And I was not rebellious** , / Nor did I turn back.

Mark 9:7 And a cloud appeared, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud: **This is My Son, the Beloved. Hear Him!**

Luke 10:39 And she had a sister called Mary, who also **sat at the Lord's feet and was listening to His word** .

John 10:27 **My sheep hear My voice** , and I know them, and they follow Me;

Rev. 2:7 **He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches** . To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God.

Exo. 21:6 Then his master shall bring him to God and shall bring him to the door or to the doorpost, and **his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him forever** .

**Footnotes** :

Exo. 21:62A slave should stand in the position of doing nothing on his own but acting only according to the word of his master and **should have his ear open to hear the voice of his master** (John 5:30; Psa. 40:6; Isa. 50:4-5).

Exo. 29:201 **To serve God as priests, our hearing (ears), our working (hands), and our walking (feet) must be cleansed and sanctified by Christ's redeeming blood. We must learn how to listen to the word of God** (cf. 21:2-6; Isa. 50:4-5; Luke 10:38-42), to do what is required by Him, and to walk according to His way in serving Him. In Lev. 14:14 the same procedure was used in the cleansing of a leper, indicating that in the eyes of God we sinners who have been ordained to be His priests are unclean, like lepers.

S.S. 8:131 **The lover of Christ asks Him who dwells in the believers as His gardens to let her hear His voice while her companions listen for His voice** . This indicates that in the work that we as the lovers of Christ do for Him as our Beloved, we should fellowship with Him. **As we are working with Him, we need to maintain our fellowship with Him, always listening to Him** (cf. Luke 10:38-42 and note 421).

Ezek. 1:251 This is God's voice. **The living creatures standing still and dropping their wings indicates that they know not only how to speak and sound forth their voice but also how to listen to God's voice** (cf. Exo. 21:5-6; Isa. 50:4-5; Luke 10:38-42).

Luke 10:421, par. 1 **The Lord prefers that His saved ones who love Him listen to Him (v. 39) that they may know His desire, rather than do things for Him without knowing His will** (cf. 1 Sam. 15:22; Eccl. 5:1).

1 Tim. 4:12 This is the Spirit who dwells in our spirit and speaks to us there (Rom. 8:9-11, 16). **In order to listen to the Spirit's speaking and be kept from the deceiving spirits and teachings of demons, we need to exercise our spirit that it may become keen and clear** .

Rev. 2:71 Although our angle and position may be right, **we still may not have the proper ear to hear** . Chapter 1 emphasizes seeing and chs. 2 and 3 emphasize hearing. **In spiritual things, seeing depends on hearing. The writer of this book first heard the voice (1:10) and then saw the vision (1:12). If our ears are dull and cannot hear, then we cannot see** (Isa. 6:9-10). The Jews would not hear the word of the Lord, so they could not see what the Lord was doing according to the new testament (Matt. 13:15; Acts 28:27). **The Lord always wants to open our ears to hear His voice** (Job 33:14-16; Isa. 50:4-5; Exo. 21:6) **that we may see things according to His economy** . **The dull ears need to be circumcised** (Jer. 6:10; Acts 7:51). **The sinners' ears need to be cleansed with the redeeming blood and anointed with the Spirit** (Lev. 14:14, 17, 28). **To serve the Lord as priests, we must have our ears cleansed with the redeeming blood** (Exo. 29:20; Lev. 8:23-24). According to this book, as the Spirit is speaking to the churches, **we all need an opened, circumcised, cleansed, and anointed ear to hear the Spirit's speaking** .

**Ministry Excerpts** :

If we want to understand the Lord's word, there must be a close, affectionate friendship between us and God. **We must also learn to listen to the Lord's word. Mary not only sat at the Lord's feet but also listened to His word. The Lord's will is often expressed through His word. Thus, if we want to know how to understand the Lord's will, we must let Him speak and we must listen to His speaking** . When Abraham was fellowshipping with God, he let God finish speaking (Gen. 18:33). He listened to God until God finished speaking, so he clearly and thoroughly understood the will of God. Often we do not allow the Lord to speak, and we do not listen to Him in our fellowship with Him. Even when we let the Lord speak and we listen to Him, we often do not allow Him to finish speaking and we do not listen until He has finished. Therefore, it is difficult to clearly know the will of God. Mary sat at the Lord's feet, but she was not like us. She allowed the Lord to speak, and she listened to Him. She also allowed the Lord to finish speaking, and she listened until He was finished. Therefore, she understood the Lord's prophetic revelation of His death and poured pure ointment on Him ahead of time, which He praised. The other disciples could not understand the Lord's will concerning His death, because they did not listen to the Lord in this way. **Listening to the Lord's word is absolutely necessary to understanding the will of God.** (_Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures, Vol. 2_, Chapter 10)

**Our hearing is mentioned first because it affects our working and our moving. The blood of Christ deals with our ear for listening to God's word, to God's speaking** . To serve God as priests, we should be faithful slaves, or servants, to God. As Isaiah 50:4 and 5 indicate, a servant must have a hearing ear. A servant who does not listen to his master's word cannot serve him according to his will, heart, anddesire.

**The first thing that we as God's priests need to deal with is our listening.** Positive listening will rescue us from negative listening. **If we listen to God's word from morning to evening, we will not have an ear to listen to any negative speaking** . Negative talk prevails and spreads in the church life because certain ones turn their ears from God to something else. These ones do not speak Christ, the word of God, grace, or the gospel. Instead, they listen to negative things, and they work and move according to the negative things they hear. The result is the spreading of death. If we turn our ears from other things back to God Himself, there will not be any problems, and only life will be spreading, not death. (_Life-Study of Leviticus_, Chapter 30)

Do you think that when the Lord came into Martha's home in Bethany His desire was to be served with material things? To be sure, it was not His desire to be served with food. On the contrary, **His desire was that His saved ones would listen to Him in order to know what was on His heart. The Lord did not care about eating; He wanted those who loved Him to be silent, to sit with Him, to listen to Him, and to concentrate on His speaking. In this way they would know His desire and preference.**

In 10:39 Mary sat at the Lord's feet listening to His word. Later, she prepared ointment to anoint Him before His death. **How did Mary know to do this? I believe she came to know this through listening to the Savior's speaking.**** By sitting at the Savior's feet and listening to His word, she came to know His desire and preference.**

Today most of the Lord's saved ones are busy trying to serve Him. They may also be trying to make the Savior busy. But those who know the Lord and who know His desire and preference would say, "Don't be so busy. The Lord wants to rest. The most precious thing to Him is not that you work for Him or try to do things for Him. **What is most precious to Him is that you sit with Him and silently listen to His word. If you sit with the Lord and listen to His word, you will know His desire and preference** ." (_Life-Study of Luke_, Chapter 26)

If we love the Lord, we will keep His commandments (14:15, 21, 23). In 14:21 the Lord said, "He who has My commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves Me; and he who loves Me shall be loved by My Father, and I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him." If we keep the Lord's commandments, we shall be loved by the Father and the Son, and the Son will manifest Himself to us. **Tell me, according to your experience, when the Lord spoke the word "no" to you and you obeyed Him, what was the result? You found yourself immediately in the presence of the Lord. But if we do not care for that little word "no," we shall lose His presence. Whenever we listen to His speaking and keep His commandments, His presence is immediately intensified and becomes so sweet, precious, watering, strengthening, enlightening, and nourishing. This is the manifestation of the indwelling Christ.** (_Life-Study of John_, Chapter 32)
