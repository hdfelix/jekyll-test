Regard with utmost esteem, love intensely, pay divine honor

**Scriptures** :

John 5:23 In order that **all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father** . He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.

John 12:3 Then Mary took a pound of ointment, of very valuable pure nard, and **anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair** ; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.

Luke 7:37 And behold, there was a woman in the city who was a sinner, and when she learned that He was reclining at table in the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster flask of ointment. 38 **And she stood behind Him at His feet weeping and began to wet His feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head, and she kissed His feet affectionately and anointed them with the ointment** .

Rom. 9:5 Whose are the fathers, and out of whom, as regards what is according to flesh, is **the Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen**

1 Pet. 2:7 **To you therefore who believe is the preciousness** ; but to the unbelieving, "The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the head of the corner,"

Rev. 5:12 Saying with a loud voice, **Worthy is the Lamb who has been slain to receive the power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing** .

**Footnotes** :

1 Pet. 2:42 [precious] Or, held in honor; differing from the word used in 1:19. There the word denotes preciousness in essence; **here it indicates preciousness that is recognized and held in honor by men** .

1 Pet. 2:71 In Greek, a word kindred to precious in vv. 4, 6. **The very Christ chosen by God as a stone, even a cornerstone that is precious to God, is the preciousness to His believers** ; but to the unbelievers He is a rejected, despised stone.

**Ministry Excerpts** :

When a new believer prays with Matthew 1:1, he may not know who David and Abraham are. **He may simply pray, "O Lord Jesus, I do not know who David is or who Abraham is. But I do know that You, Lord, are the Son of God who became the Son of David. O Lord, You are the Son of God, but You became the Son of Man. Lord, I praise You, I adore You, and I worship You. You are God, but You became a man." If this believer reads the word in this way, he will receive not knowledge but the living Christ Himself.** The more he prays in this way, the more the living Christ will be prayed into him. After reading and praying in this way for several minutes, he will be filled, satisfied, and refreshed. (_Enjoying Christ as the Word and the Spirit through Prayer_, Chapter 3, Section 3, p. 31)

**In order to learn how to enjoy Christ by praying, we must drop the old way of prayer. Also, we should not pray for business affairs or personal concerns. Instead, pray to praise Him, to adore Him, to thank Him, to behold His beauty, and to inhale Him.** Many times we have to pray by groaning, saying, "O Lord, O Lord...." This is the best prayer. The real prayer is not out of us, so that the Lord will do something for us. The real prayer is the Spirit, who is Christ Himself, working and moving within us, that we would open to Him to breathe Him out and breathe Him in (see Hymns, #255). We must offer Him the free way to go out and to come in to express something of Himself.

We need to practice the fellowship in this chapter. We first must learn to read and pray over the Word. We also need to pray to behold the Lord and breathe the Lord as our spiritual air. Perhaps in the morning we can take ten or fifteen minutes for reading and praying over the Word. **After this we need another time, perhaps five minutes, just to pray. We should open ourselves to the Lord, look to Him, and seek His face to behold Him, adore Him, worship Him, praise Him, and thank Him.** If we have some feeling within which we do not know how to express, we can groan before Him. If we practice this kind of living and intimate prayer, we will be nourished, refreshed, and strengthened by the Lord not only in the morning but also throughout the day. (_Enjoying Christ as the Word and the Spirit through Prayer_, Chapter 7, Section 2, pp. 67-68, 71)

After we have spent twenty or twenty-five minutes to enjoy the Lord by dealing with His word, we need a time simply to pray. During this time we should not be preoccupied with what we have read. **We should keep nothing in mind and simply seek His face, open ourselves, behold Him, look to Him, and speak something about Him, about His goodness and beauty, to adore and worship Him** .

At first, some may begin their prayer by saying, "Lord, I confess that I do not know how to enjoy You or praise You in this way." This may be good, but it is only the beginning of the practice of prayer. After we practice this kind of prayer some more, we should not say that we do not know how. Rather, when we come to the Lord, we should express something very positively from our inner realization. We may realize that the Lord is sweet, so we can pray, "O Lord, You are so sweet!" We may also realize that the Lord is so available, **so we can say, "Lord, I adore You! You are so available. O Lord, I adore You and praise You for Your availability.** " In this way we can speak something positively with assurance and confirmation. (_Enjoying Christ as the Word and the Spirit through Prayer_, Chapter 8, Section 1, p. 73)

**When we pray to adore the Lord and praise Him, we have to learn to drop the natural and religious thought. We have many positive items from the Scriptures with which we can praise the Lord.** There is no need for us to use utterance that comes from the religious, natural feeling. We should learn to speak things from deep within and also to use the utterances from the Bible. We see this kind of speaking in the prayer of Samuel's mother (1 Sam. 1:10-11) and the praise of Mary, the mother of the Lord Jesus (Luke 1:46-55). We also need to learn to pray in the way Paul prayed in Ephesians 1:17 through 23 and 3:14 through 21. **When we praise and adore the Lord, we need to drop our natural thought, concept, and feeling and speak something heavenly, spiritual, new, full of life, full of the anointing, and full of the sweetness of the Lord.** (_Enjoying Christ as the Word and the Spirit through Prayer_, Chapter 9, Section 3, p. 86)

Romans 9:5 says, "Whose are the fathers, and out of whom, as regards what is according to flesh, is the **Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen** ." The Jehovah's Witnesses have a subtle, evil, and satanic way to distort this verse. We must be clear that Christ is God over all, which means that He is above all the created things, and He is blessed forever. **The word blessed here means praised, well spoken of, with adoration of respect and desire. We adore God with our respect to Him and our desire for Him.** We worship Him in this way. We desire to have Him, and we love Him. **We have to speak well of Christ as God to tell the whole universe what He is. This is our blessing Him to praise Him with our adoration.**** Christ is our God above all things and is worthy to be praised with well-speaking of adoration, respect, and desire. **(_Crystallization-study of John,_ Chapter 5, Sec. 2, pp. 57-58)
