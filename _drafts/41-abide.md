remain, stay

**Scriptures** :

John 4:24 God is Spirit, and **those who worship Him must worship in spirit** and truthfulness.

John 14:23 Jesus answered and said to him, **If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him** .

John 15:4 **Abide in Me** and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me. 5 I am the vine; you are the branches. **He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit** ; for apart from Me you can do nothing.

John 15:7 **If you abide in Me and My words abide in you,** ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you.

**Footnotes** :

1 John 2:6, note 1 (abides) To be in Christ is the beginning of the Christian life. Our being put in Christ was God's doing once for all (1 Cor. 1:30). **To abide in Christ is the continuation of the Christian life. This is our responsibility in our daily walk,** a walk that is a copy of Christ's walk on earth. See note 278.

1 John 2:27, note 8 (abide): **The Greek word means to stay** (in a given place, state, relation, or expectancy); hence, to **abide, remain, and dwell** . To abide in Him is to abide in the Son and in the Father (v. 24). This is to remain and dwell in the Lord (John 15:4-5). It is also to abide in the fellowship of the divine life and to walk in the divine light (1:2-3, 6-7), i.e., abide in the divine light (v. 10). **We should practice this abiding according to the teaching of the all-inclusive anointing, that our fellowship with God (1:3, 6) may be maintained** .

**Ministry Excerpts** :

**Our topic in this message is "How to Abide in Christ." It is this book of John which gives us the key. While chapter fifteen is the central chapter on this, the surrounding chapters are all related to it** . For many years I did not realize this. As a young man seeking after the Lord, I surely loved the word in John 15 on abiding. But I kept wondering how to do it. (_Life Messages_, p. 92)

**To abide in Christ, then, begins with the divine birth in chapter one. Chapter three goes on to tell us that this birth from above involves two spirits.** The worship in John 4, of the Spirit by the human spirit, also involves the two spirits. (Ibid., p. 92)

**In 6:63 John proceeds from the two spirits to the Word** . "It is the Spirit Who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life." **Abiding is not merely a matter of the Spirit; the Word is also involved. The Greek here is the instant, practical, present word of the Lord** . (Ibid., pp. 92-93)

Notice [John] 14:23. "Jesus answered and said to him, If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him **." This word abode is the noun form of abide. The Father and Son will come to the one who loves Them not only for a visit but to make an abode. This abode is mutual. They will abide in him, and he will abide in Them. The abiding in chapter fifteen comes from the abode, or mutual abiding place, in 14:23** . (Ibid., p. 93)

How can we be branches in the vine? **How can we abide in Him and have Him abide in us?**** For many years I could not figure this out, until one day I saw that as the life-giving Spirit He had entered into my spirit, just to be one with me. I am one with Him, not in my mind, emotion, or will, but in my spirit**.

Today the Lord is no more Jesus in the flesh. He is now the life-giving Spirit. Concerning His exaltation, He is at the Father's right hand as Lord of all (Acts 2:32-36). But **concerning His indwelling, He is within us as the life-giving Spirit** . **Because He is in our spirit, we are one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). This one spirit is the vine. These two spirits are one in the divine life and one in the divine nature** .

**If you see this, there is only one more thing I need to mention, and that is, how to abide in Him. There is no need for you to do anything except abide.**

**I would like to tell you the secret of abiding. This is based upon my experience, not on the black and white pages of the Bible. Matters concerning life are not characterized by feeling. If you have a stomachache, you know something is wrong. If you have a pain in the chest, you need to see a doctor. When you are in good health, however, you are not conscious of any particular feeling. The same is true when you are abiding. As soon as you are out of Christ, you are aware of it** . If you criticize a brother, you know deep within that you are not abiding. Even in a small matter, like smiling a little, you may sense that you are not abiding. You may say yes to a question and sense that your answer was a political one, spoken apart from the abiding.

When you find yourself in a difficult situation, do not reactâ€¦ **Practicing not to do anything is the negative secret of abiding in the Lord!**

By this divine birth two spirits have been joined into one. The divine part within has the desire to worship the Father; the divine Spirit would worship by your human spirit. This divine part also loves and appreciates the words spoken by the Lord, His instant practical speaking. This divine part further tells you that the Father and the Son are making an abode with you, and that you are abiding in Him. **Whenever you sense within that you are not abiding, say, "Lord, forgive me and cleanse me. I don't want to be out of the abiding. I want to stay in You all the time."** (Ibid., pp. 94-95)

To believe in the Lord is adequate for us to have the divine birth. **But to enjoy the divine birth by abiding, we need to love Him. The Gospel of John first tells us to believe in Him, then to love Him. "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him" (14:23). This making of the mutual abode depends upon a constant love on our part.** (On His side the love is always there.)

**Stay in this divine place, involving the two spirits. Worship here. Receive the instant word of the Lord. As you live in Him and He dwells in you, there is a mutual abode. In this place you are holy. Your Christ will be no longer merely doctrinal. He will be your experience all the time. You will be able to testify that you are one with Him and He with you, even that you are abiding in this oneness** .(Ibid., pp. 96-97)

So when we speak of staying in the spirit, we mean in the blended spirit, in the mingled spirit. Hallelujah! We have a spirit, and our spirit has been regenerated, the Spirit of God dwells in our spirit and mingles Himself with our spirit making the two one spirit. **This**** is the spirit in which we have to remain. How can we remain in such a spirit? All the time we have to, "O Lord! O Lord!" The best way to keep you in your spirit and to save you from losing your temper is to "O Lord."** (_Perfecting Training_, p. 445)

All He is to me.

As I dwell in You, everything is fine.

Here I'd like to be, Lord, all the time.

Here I'm Yours, dear Lord, and You are mine.

3I'm a branch that's been, Lord, grafted in.

I'm supplied in You in this life union.

Here Your riches, Lord, in this sweet life flow.

As I dwell in You, I will surely grow.

4 As I dwell in You, and You in me,

Here I'm joined to You, Lord, practically.

As I stay with You, as You're with me,

We will mingle, Lord, subjectively.

5 As I'm loving You and enjoying You, Lord,

You become in me the rhema word.

Here I'll pray in You as You pray in me.

You'll bear fruit in me, Lord, abundantly.

6 As I dwell in You, Lord You're flowing through.

Lord, You're filling me, overflowing too.

Here we all are one and expressing You.

Here our joy is full as we dwell in You.

_ **Hymn 1163, s. 1** _

1. He's the vine and we're the branches,We should e'er abide in Him,And let Him abide within usAs the flow of life within.

In the vine, in the vine,  
In the vine, in the vine,  
We would know Thee, Lord,  
more deeply,  
E'er abiding in the vine.
