**Scriptures** :

Psa. 34:8 **Taste and see that Jehovah is good;** / Blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him.

Psa. 119:103 **How sweet are Your words to my taste!** / Sweeter than honey to my mouth!

S. S. 2:3 As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, / So is my beloved among the sons: In his shade I delighted and sat down, **/ And his fruit was sweet to my taste** .

1 Pet. 2:2 As newborn babes, **long for the guileless milk of the word** in order that by it you may grow unto salvation, 3 **If you have tasted that the Lord is good.**

Heb. 6:4 For it is impossible for those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit 5 **And have tasted the good word of God** and the powers of the age to come.

**Footnotes** :

Psa. 34:8, note 1 **God with His goodness can be tasted by us** (1 Pet. 2:3 and note 1). **We taste and see that God is good in His house, that is, in Christ, in the church, and eventually in the New Jerusalem** . See note 11 in Psa. 25.

S.S. 2:3, note 1 The lover appreciates Christ as the source of rich provision (apple tree) who supplies her in a timely way. **She is satisfied with her delight in resting (sitting down) under Christ as an overshadowing canopy in the day (shadeâ€”Isa. 4:5-6; 2 Cor. 12:9) and with her tasting Him as the sweet, timely supply (sweet fruit)** .

1 Pet. 2:3, note 1 **The Lord can be tasted, and His taste is pleasant and good. If we have tasted Him, we will long for the nourishing milk in His word** (v. 2).

**Ministry Excerpts** :

**David said, "How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth" (Psa. 119:103). The Word is an enjoyment, and it is even sweeter and more pleasant than honey to our taste. From all these verses we realize that the Word of God is not only for us to learn, but more for us to taste, to eat, to enjoy, and to digest** .

**Then in 1 Peter 2:2-3 we see that to eat the Word is to taste the Lord** . "As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word in order that by it you may grow unto salvation, if you have tasted that the Lord is good." **In verse 2 there is the eating of the Word, and in verse 3, the tasting of the Lord** . **When we eat the Word of God as our spiritual nourishment, we taste the Lord** . Therefore, like Jeremiah, we must eat the Word; then we will enjoy the Lord and receive spiritual nourishment.(_Time with the Lord, A,_ Chapter 1, Section 2)

To pray is to dig the well. When you first practice to pray, you may not have any feeling, but if you pray a little longer, the love toward the Lord will gush up from within you. Sometimes you will even weep because you see that although you are so wicked, the Lord loves you so much. This is the release of the Spirit. Then **when you continue to pray according to the feeling within you, you have a sweet experience. If you stop praying, however, you will be like a car whose ignition is turned off and needs to be restarted. Initially you may not like to pray, but the more you practice, the more you will taste the sweetness of praying, and the more you will like to pray. This is to dig the well.** (_Abiding in the Lord to Enjoy His Life,_ Chapter 4, Section 4)

**In the Bible there is the taste of God. When we read the Bible and touch God in our spirit, we do sense the taste of God. You may ask me what this taste of God is. I would say that I cannot describe it. All I know is that I have touched the sweetness of God and have experienced His taste** .

This is the reason that many times when we read the Bible we have the joy. When we read worldly books and newspapers, sometimes there may be things that make us happy. But it is not the same kind of joy, nor the same intensity of joy, as when we read the Bible. **When we read the Bible and touch God in the spirit, we have the realization deep within that we have absorbed God. We have the sense that we have eaten God, drunk God, and enjoyed God.**

If you never have this kind of realization in reading the Bible, you must be reading the Bible in a dead way. You are reading only the letters and have not touched God's breathing out in the letters. This is not the proper way to read the Bible. **If you read the Bible properly, not only will you feel that you have touched God, but you will feel that you have tasted God. If you read the Bible in the proper way, not only will you feel the presence of God, but you will have the feeling that you are touching God. You will also have the sweet sensation that you have tasted God Himself** .

Brothers and sisters, the Bible is the breathing out of God. God breathes Himself out so that we can breathe Him in. **When we breathe Him into us as our enjoyment, we sense a special taste** . It is more than a sense of rest, or peace, or joy, or sweetness. It is beyond the description of human words. **The greatest joy or blessing of being a Christian is to touch and taste God Himself through the God-breathed word. This is to eat the spiritual meal. By this, one will be fed and satisfied** .

We do not read the Bible only for enlightenment, teaching, or instruction. There is something higher and deeper than all these. It is to touch God Himself in our inward parts. The Bible is not merely God's thought, doctrine, truth, or teaching. The word in the Bible is the breathing out of God. It is God who breathes Himself out. God Himself is in the word. He Himself is in the breath. Therefore, we cannot understand the word only with our mind. This is not enough. **We must learn to use our spirit to contact these words; we must touch God's breathing out in the words and must touch His element in the words. When we have such a contact, not only will we feel that we are in the presence of God, and not only will we have touched God, but we also will feel that we have tasted God** ; God will become our enjoyment within. **Whenever we have a good Bible reading, we have a good eating and drinking. It will satisfy us within, and we will truly have tasted the sweetness of God Himself** . (_On Knowing the Bible,_ Chapter 1, Section 6).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 564, s. 1** _

I have learned the wondrous secret  
Of abiding in the Lord;  
I have tasted life's pure fountain,  
I am drinking of His word;  
I have found the strength and sweetness  
Of abiding 'neath the blood;  
I have lost myself in Jesus,  
I am sinking into God.

I'm abiding in the Lord  
And confiding in His word;  
I am hiding in the bosom of His love.  
Yes, abiding in the Lord  
And confiding in His word,  
I am hiding in the bosom of His love.

_ **Hymn 783** _

1Pray to touch the throne of God,

Touch the throne of grace divine,

Grace to find and mercy too

Which will meet the need of thine.

2Pray to touch the throne of God,

Deeply sense thy need of grace;

In the spirit stay with God,

Fellowshipping face to face.

3Pray to touch the throne of God,

Learning all the wealth of grace;

Ever take and ever taste,

Giving God the thanks and praise.

_ **Hymn 1142, ss. 1-3** _

1. Jesus is the living Spirit,

Our reality;

We enjoy Him just by calling

In simplicity.

Jesus is the living Spirit,

We must now proclaim;

He is rich unto all men

That call upon His name.

1. He is living now within us,

Giving liberty;

He is good and He is gracious

As we taste and see.

1. Jesus is the living Spirit

And the living Word;

When we touch Him by pray-reading

We receive this Lord.

_ **Hymn 983** _

1. There is a stream which issues forth

From God's eternal throne

And from the Lamb, a living stream,

Clear as the crystal stone.

In it doth grow the tree of life,

It makes the ransomed sing:

Its living draught revives the heart;

Hence all the joys do spring.

1. Such joys as are unspeakable,

And full of glory too;

Such splendid riches, meat and drink,

As worldlings do not know.

Eye hath not seen, nor ear hath heard,

For fancy 'tis concealed,

What Thou, Lord, hast laid up for Thine

And hast to me revealed.

1. I feel Thy touch, I hear Thy voice,

I taste Thy sweetest grace;

My soul doth leap: but, oh, that I

May see Thee face to face!

Then with the saints my soul shall feast

On joys that always last:

Blest be my God, the God of joy,

That gives here such a taste!
