Cease, silent

**Scriptures** :

Psa. 4:4b Consider in your heart upon your bed, / **And be silent. Selah**

Psa. 46:10 - **Be still and know that I am God** . "I will be exalted among the nations; I will be exalted on earth."

Psa. 143:6 I spread out my hands to You; / My soul thirsts for You like a parched land. **Selah**

Isa. 40:31 **Yet those who wait on Jehovah will renew their strength** ; / They will mount up with wings like eagles; / They will run and will not faint; / They will walk and will not become weary.

Hab. 2:20 - But Jehovah is in His holy temple: " **Be silent before Him** , all the earth!"

Zech. 2:13 - **Hush, all flesh, before Jehovah** ! For He is roused up from His holy habitation.

**Footnotes** :

Exo 20:8, note 1 See note 231 in ch. 16.The Sabbath signifies that God has done everything, completed everything, and prepared everything and that man must stop all his work. **To keep the Sabbath is to stop our work and to take God and all that He has accomplished for us as our enjoyment, rest, and satisfaction** . This is God's economy. See note 21 in Gen. 2.

Isa 40:31, note 1, par. 1 To wait on the eternal God (v. 28) means that we terminate ourselves, i.e., **that we stop ourselves with our living, our doing, and our activity, and receive God in Christ as our life, our person, and our replacement.** Such a waiting one will be renewed and strengthened to such an extent that he will mount up with wings like eagles. He will not only walk and run but also soar in the heavens, far above every earthly frustration. This is a transformed person. This chapter leads us to a comparison between Hezekiah, a godly man who was still in the old creation (chs. 36—39), and a regenerated and transformed person in the new creation.

Isa 58:3, note 1 The real meaning of fasting is to stop eating all things other than the Lord Jesus and to not have a taste for anything other than Him. **God wants us to stop our doing and be replaced by Christ** (keep the Sabbath—56:2) and to keep away from the taste of anything other than Christ (fast). **By resting and fasting we can partake of all that the processed Christ has accomplished for us** . In totality, what Christ is and has accomplished is just the divine water (55:1), which is the consummated Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God for us to drink and enjoy (John 7:37-39; 1 Cor. 12:13).

**Ministry Excerpts** :

When we contact God, we must exercise to turn our whole being to our spirit. We should seek Him in our spirit. **We close our eyes when we pray to stop from being distracted, turn to our spirit, and touch God.** For this reason we also should not be too quick to open our mouth. Rather, we should be calm and have a period of silence. Good prayer does not depend on an abundance of words. It is good to be silent at the beginning of our prayer, and it is also good to have a period of silence during our prayer. Many psalms in the Bible end with _ **selah** _ **. This is the equivalent of a rest note in music notation. It tells a person to stop, to halt for a while** . Because our words of prayer can distract us from the spirit, there is the need of a halt to bring our entire person back to the spirit. There are times, however, when we cannot stop; a stop may drive away the spirit. What we should do depends on the circumstance. **In prayer, we need to learn to be silent. There is no need to be in a hurry. We need to be at ease and quiet** (How to Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God, Chapter 12).

**When we pray, we close our eyes not only to concentrate but also to stop our outward being** . Our outward being often wanders with our eyes. By closing our eyes when we pray, we close the gate of our eyes, shut the door to the outside world, and turn the direction of our being to our spirit. **After we stop our entire being and close the door to the outside world, we will be able to turn to the deepest part of our being and exercise our spirit** . When we turn to exercise our spirit, we immediately touch God and appear before Him in our spirit (_How to Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God_, Chapter 5).

One who knows how to pray can usually quietly rest his mind. Not only is he able to concentrate with his mind, but he can also quiet his thinking. It is just like the rest sign in music. A pianist coming to a rest sign first pauses and then goes on. **It is also similar to the term** _ **selah** _ **in the Psalms, which designates a certain time of silence. Sometimes our prayer before God needs to come to a halt. We need to train and control our mind to such an extent that we can think, pause, concentrate, and obey at will. Thus, we can be a man of prayer** .

The stillness of the mind is not only a pause in the mind's activities, but also includes **resting one's mind** . **One whose thinking never ceases uses his mind to excess and will experience a very difficult time in prayer because his mind cannot be still** . Many times we are unable to pray before going to bed at night. This is also due to the fact that our mind has hardly stopped during the day and is exhausted. The spirit desires to pray, but the mind is tired and cannot be used. This is very damaging to prayer. Thus, **in order to pray, it is necessary that you frequently still your mind.** You not only need to refrain from foolish thinking and vain imaginings, but sometimes you need to stop even the proper use of the mind. Always reserve a portion of your mental capacity for the purpose of prayer. **If the mind is not properly controlled there will be a problem in prayer** (_Lessons on Prayer,_ Chapter 6).

[Others] can be compared to a car that has no brakes; they are unable to stop themselves. It is not easy for such a person to turn to his spirit and pray... **When we are busy with many outward things, there is no way for us to touch God. When we want to pray, we must free ourselves from all affairs, stop our mental activities, and turn our entire being from outward things to our spirit** (_How to Enjoy God and Practice the Enjoyment of God_, Chapter 19).

You may consider that you like to live Christ and because you can't make it, you need to fast, and you need to pray. You may want to do these things, but He doesn't. What is religion? Religion is that you and I would do something to please God. You and I would initiate something to please God. What is God's economy? God's economy is that He has prepared everything…According to Luke 15 everything was prepared for the prodigal son's return. When the son came home, the Father had the best robe put upon him… If the son never came back, how could the Father save him? **But if, after coming back, the son was too busy doing things, how could the robe be put upon him? The Father stopped the son's talking and put the robe upon him. Then he said to kill the fatted calf and to be merry. This is to be saved. To be saved simply means to turn to God and calm yourself down** . Let the Lord do everything, not only for you, but upon you and in you. The more we do to get salvation, the more the Lord is frustrated. He cannot do anything. This is a real picture of the situation with so many Christians. After turning to the Lord, they get involved in too much doing. Sometimes when the Lord would see that we are so active, He would just wait until we have done everything and have been thoroughly disappointed and have given up. When we are tired out the Lord would say, "Very good! Now is the time for you to be saved. Let Me save you. Don't do anything. Don't pray; let Me save you. Don't read the Bible, let Me save you. Don't do your good work, **let Me save you. Stop. Just turn to Me. Love Me, and tell Me you want Me.** You cannot do anything." (_Perfecting Training,_ Chapter 20).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 764, s. 1** _

Lord, in Thy presence silent I would be,

That in the inmost I to Thee may come;

I would not in my own way pray to Thee,

But let Thy prayer in me my prayer become.

_ **Hymn 643, ss. 3, 4** _

3Take time to behold Him,

Let Him be thy guide;

And run not before Him

Whatever betide;

In joy or in sorrow

Still follow thy Lord,

And, looking to Jesus,

Still trust in His Word.

4Take time to behold Him,

Be calm in thy soul,

Each thought and each temper

Beneath His control.

Thus led by His Spirit

To fountains of love,

Thou then shalt be fitted

His mercy to prove.

_ **Hymn 841, s. 6** _

I would cease completely

From my efforts vain,

Let Thy life transform me,

Full release to gain;

Build me up with others

Till in us Thou see

Thy complete expression

Glorifying Thee.

_ **Hymn 477, s. 2 and chorus** _

What e'er thou lovest, man,

That too become thou must;

God, if thou lovest God,

Dust, if thou lovest dust.

Go out, God will come in;

Die thou and let Him live;

Be not and He will be;

Wait and He'll all things give.

O, Cross of Christ, I take thee

Into this heart of mine,

That I to my own self may die

And rise to thy life Divine.

22 - Stop
