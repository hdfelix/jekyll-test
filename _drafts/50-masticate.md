chew, ruminate

**Scriptures** :

Lev. 11:2 Speak to the children of Israel, saying, These are the animals which you may eat among all the beasts that are on the earth. 3 Whatever has a divided hoof, that is, has its hoof split in two, and **chews the cud among the beasts, that you may eat.**

Psa. 119:15 **I will muse upon Your precepts** / And regard Your ways.

Jer. 15:16 **Your words were found and I ate them,** / And Your word became to me / The gladness and joy of my heart, / For I am called by Your name, / O Jehovah, God of hosts.

John 6:54 **He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life** , and I will raise him up in the last day. 56 **He**** who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me **and I in him. 57 As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so** he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me **. 58 This is the bread which came down out of heaven, not as the fathers ate and died;** he who eats this bread shall live forever**.

**Footnotes** :

Lev 11:21 **To eat is to contact things outside of us and to receive them into us, with the result that they eventually become our inner constitution** . In this chapter all the animals signify different kinds of people, and eating signifies our contacting of people (cf. Acts 10:9b-14, 27-29). For God's people to live a holy life as required by the holy God, they must be careful about the kind of people they contact (cf. vv. 46-47; 1 Cor. 15:33; 2 Cor. 6:14-18).

Lev 11:31 Lit., divides the hoof, that is, splits the split of its hoofs (cf. vv. 7, 26). Animals that divide the hoof and **chew the cud** (v. 3; cf. vv. 4-8, 26-28) signify persons who have discernment in their activities (Phil. 1:9-10) and **who receive the word of God with much reconsideration (see note 15**** 1 ****in Psa. 119)** .

Psa 119:151 (muse) Rich in meaning, the Hebrew word for muse (often translated meditate in the KJV) implies to worship, to converse with oneself, and to speak aloud. **To muse on the word is to taste and enjoy it through careful considering. Prayer, speaking to oneself, and praising the Lord may also be included in musing on the word. To muse on the word of God is to enjoy His word as His breath (2 Tim. 3:16) and thus to be infused with God, to breathe God in, and to receive spiritual nourishment** .

John 6:541 (eats) Lit., **masticates; so in vv. 56, 57, 58** .

**Ministry Excerpts** :

Some Christian groups may speak about and stress that Jesus is the bread of life, but very few have told people to eat Christ. In John 6:48 the Lord Jesus said that He was the bread of life, and **in John 6:57 He said, "He who eats Me shall also live because of Me." In Greek the word for "eats" in verse 57 is literally "masticates." To masticate is to eat finely, thoroughly, and absolutely** . Jesus came not only to die for our sins but also to be our daily bread, our food. Christ being the bread of life and the matter of eating Him are mentioned together in the same chapter. This is logical. The Lord Jesus told us that He is the bread of life, and He must also show us how to take Him as the bread. The bread is not for our appreciation outwardly; it is for our eating (_The Scriptural Way to Meet and to Serve for the Building Up of the Body of Christ,_ Chapter 11).

**Chewing the cud signifies receiving the word of God with much consideration and reconsideration. Just as a cow chews its cud, we should consider and reconsider the word of God. We may do this while we pray-read early in the morning. As we are pray-reading, we may consider and reconsider the word. This is to chew the cud to receive nourishment by reconsidering what we receive from God's word** (_Life-Study of Leviticus,_ Chapter 36).

We should not merely exercise our mentality to understand the Bible in its black and white letters. Of course, we need understanding. If we do not understand English, for example, we can never understand an English version of the Bible. We must know the words and understand them with our mind. However, this is not all. **After we understand the words, we must immediately exercise our spirit. This requires much prayer. We may illustrate this by eating. When we eat, it is important to thoroughly chew our food. The more time we spend to chew the food, the more we get the nourishment and the easier it is to digest it.** Chewing food illustrates the way to read the Word with the exercise of the spirit. After we see the words, read the words, and understand them, **we need to "chew" them. This is done not by our understanding but by our prayer** (_General Sketch of the New Testament in the Light of Christ and the Church, A - Part 2: Romans through Philemon,_ Chapter 12).

Satan on the one hand has been bruised and destroyed on the cross, yet on the other hand he is still here making trouble. As human beings, we are under the damaging influence of Satan. **How can we destroy this damaging serpent? There is only one way—by feeding on the humanity of Jesus!** If we enjoy and eat His humanity, the serpent is destroyed. **In John 6:57 the Lord says, "he who eats Me shall also live because of Me." The word "eat" in this verse is a special word, a word which is different from the other words used in this chapter for eating. One version translates this word as "masticate." This means to chew finely, to eat bit by bit in a slow and fine way. We have to eat the Lord, and sometimes we need to masticate Him** . This is not to eat roughly, but bit by bit. When we eat too fast, our digestion is impaired. **So we must learn to masticate the Lord's humanity** . If we eat Him in this way, the old serpent will be nailed to the cross again. **This kind of masticating will bruise the head of the serpent** . We need to feast on Jesus as the man (_Christ as the Reality,_ Chapter 8).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 1145** _

1. God gave His Son to man to be

The tree of life so rich and free,

That every man may taste and see

That God is good for food.

Yes, God is good for food!

Yes, God is good for food!

We've tasted and we testify

That God is good for food!

1. We eat this feast and take God in,

And as we eat we live by Him,

For all the elements within

This feast are God Himself.

Yes, Jesus is our feast!

Yes, Jesus is our feast!

We eat this feast and live by Him,

For Jesus is our feast!

1. Christ Jesus is the food we eat;

He is our bread, He is our meat;

He is our life-supply complete;

We daily eat of Him.

We daily eat of Him,

We daily eat of Him.

He is our life-supply complete;

We daily eat of Him.

To men it's so available,

For God said whosoever will

May come and freely eat.

_ **Hymn 1146** _

1. Let us eat Jesus every day,

Eating His flesh in such a way

That in the trials great or small

He as a Man will be our all.

Eat, eat more of Jesus!

Eat, eat more of Jesus!

Why should we undernourished be

When we have His humanity?

1. Let us drink Jesus till we see

That we are human, Jesusly!

Till rivers flood the barren ground

And quench the thirst of all around.

Drink, drink more of Jesus!

Drink, drink more of Jesus!

Why should we ever thirsty be

When we have His humanity?

1. We must eat Jesus till God can

Have the fulfillment of His plan—

One man expressed for all to see,

One church in each locality.

We'll masticate Jesus!

We'll masticate Jesus!

Then to the tent of meeting bring

Jesus, our real meal offering.
