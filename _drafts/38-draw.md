Draw near, Come Forward

**Scriptures** :

James 4:8a **Draw near to God** , and He will draw near to you.

Heb. 10:19 Having therefore, brothers, **boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus.** 20 Which entrance He initiated for us as a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh.

Heb. 10:22 **Let us come forward to the Holy of Holies** with a true heart in full assurance of faith, **having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience** and having our bodies washed with pure water.

**Ministry Excerpts** :

**God the Father not only is seen by the pure in heart but also draws near to those who draw near to Him. James 4:8 says, "Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you.** " God can be seen, but we need to be pure in heart. Likewise, God desires to draw near to us, but we need to draw near to Him. If we do not draw near to Him, He will not draw near to us in our experience. **His drawing near to us hinges on our taking the initiative first to draw near to Him** .

**Whenever we draw near to God under the redeeming blood of Christ, we sense that God is near to us. He draws near to us that we may experience and enjoy Him** . God shows His love and sympathy toward us by drawing near to us. When He draws near to us, He also comforts us, encourages us, and strengthens us. **God the Father is near to those who draw near to Him that He may give them His love, sympathize with them, and comfort, encourage, and strengthen them** . Thus, the believers experience and enjoy God as the Father in the love of God. (_Truth Lessons, Level Two, Vol. 3_, Lesson 25, p. 11)

Today we will speak a little on the way to worship God. When we come before God, some people may come with a depressed feeling. Some may feel that they have not done well during the previous week, that they have disobeyed God's word, or that they have backslidden. **As a result of these feelings, a person can be frustrated from worshipping God and drawing near to Him in a spontaneous and sweet way** .

But whether or not our works are good has nothing to do with our coming to God. Please read [Hebrews 10:] 19, "Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus." This verse tells us that our coming to God is in nothing else other than the blood of the Lord Jesus. Good works, zeal, or spiritual experiences cannot qualify us to come before God or make us more worthy to draw near to Him. **Only the blood of the Lord Jesus enables us to draw near to God. If you think that the blood of the Lord Jesus is not enough for you to draw near to Him, I will tell you honestly that you will never be able to come to Him or worship Him** . (_Collected Works of Watchman Nee_, _Vol. 19_, p. 429)

Some say that we need the Lord Jesus to do everything for us and that He is our Mediator and go-between. But there is no such thing. **Verses 19 and 20 tell us that the Lord died for us in order that we could come directly to God** . Both in the Old Testament and New Testament, the blood on the altar is for the remission of sins. But at the same time, the **blood shed on the cross is also for us to draw near to God.** Some have thought that a person receives forgiveness through the blood but that he worships and draws near to God through his works. This is why some think that when they do well that week, read the Bible, and pray all the time, they can come boldly to worship God, sing, and pray. Others think that they have not done well and therefore are not worthy to worship; they cannot sing and have no faith to pray. By doing this, they have made the blood worthless. We worship God through the blood, just as we are forgiven through the blood. (_Collected Works of Watchman Nee_, _Vol. 19_, p. 431)

The only way we can have a conscience that is void of offense is by the cleansing of the precious blood of Jesus. **Hebrews 10:22 says, "Let us come forward to the Holy of Holiesâ€¦having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience." This is the reason we must pray by means of the precious blood. Without the precious blood of the Lord Jesus, our conscience will always accuse and condemn us, making us aware of our offenses and unable to draw near to God with boldness** . However, whenever we rely on and apply the precious blood of the Lord, the offenses and condemnation in our conscience are removed, and there is no hindrance in our prayer. Therefore, we need to always keep our conscience void of offense. Whenever there is a sense of sin, a sense of accusation and offense in our conscience, we should immediately confess our sins before God and be cleansed by the Lord's blood.

The dealing for prayer is the confession of sins. A person who knows how to pray spends much of his prayer time confessing his sins. This is because there are many inward and outward problems in our being when we come before God. **If we draw near to God with a sincere heart and an open spirit, He will shine in us as light. When He shines in us, exposing our real self and true condition, we must confess our sins.** After confessing our sin in this way, we often sense another. When the Lord shines in us, we may spend the initial time in our prayer just confessing our sins.

When we do not deal with our sins by confessing them in God's light, but rather come hastily before God, abruptly asking for different things, our prayer will not touch God because there is still a barrier. Such prayer and supplication are like beating the air. **We must, therefore, have a sincere heart and an open spirit when we come before God in prayer. We need to rely on the Lord's blood and allow Him to shine in us. Then we need to confess our sins one by one according to God's shining and the inward sense.** This kind of confession is the dealing for prayer. A good prayer is often preceded by dealing with sins through confession. If we know how to pray, we will never neglect dealing with our sins by confessing when we come before God in prayer.

The Old Testament presents a very clear type of this. When a priest entered the tabernacle to minister and serve God, he first had to pass through the altar. This is a type of dealing with sins. **In order for a sinful man to draw near to God, he had to pass through the altar. This also applies to us in the New Testament age. When we draw near to God in prayer, we must first receive the shining of God and then confess our sins one by one according to the inner sense until we are transparent within, until there is a clear way between God and us** . It is at this time that we can entreat God according to the inward sense. Therefore, in a good prayer, confession always precedes supplication. (_Lessons for New Believers_, pp. 97-98)

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 387** _

1I am Thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice,

And it told Thy love to me;

But I long to rise in the arms of faith,

And be closer drawn to Thee.

Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,

To the cross where Thou hast died;

Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,

To Thy precious, bleeding side.

2Consecrate me now to Thy service, Lord,

By the pow'r of grace divine;

Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope,

And my will be lost in Thine.

3O the pure delight of a single hour

That before Thy throne I spend,

When I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my God,

I commune as friend with friend!

4There are depths of love that I yet may know

Ere Thee face to face I see;

There are heights of joy that I yet may reach

Ere I rest in peace with Thee.

_ **Hymn 813, ss. 1-4** _

1I come before Thy throne of grace

With hungry heart on Thee to feed,

Thy grace and mercy to receive

To help me in this hour of need.

2Here I behold Thy radiant face,

Its light upon my heart doth shine

With healing rays consuming all

The weaknesses and faults of mine.

3'Tis here Thy light illuminates

My true condition unto me;

'Tis here Thy blood's effectiveness

To cleanse from sin I gladly see.

4Thy Spirit too anoints me here

And makes Thy very substance mine;

Thy very self I thus enjoy

And know Thy very heart's design.

_ **There are times** _

1. There are times in my lifeWhen my heart is embittered.There are questions unanswered,Yet, You're drawing me

To enter  
Into Your blessed sanctuary  
And turning my eyes heavenward,  
The questions of constant inquiry  
Are changed to these words,

1. "Whom do I have in heavenBut You, dear Jehovah.My flesh and my heartConstantly fail,

But God's still  
The strength of my heart and my portion;  
To Him forever I'll draw near.  
I've made Jehovah my sweet refuge.  
So now throughout the years

1. Turn my view to see You,How I need to see Jesus!!Though I don't understandThe ways that You take;

Lord, make me  
A babe and suckling always praising.  
Enjoying Your worth day by day.  
Let each experience constitute me  
So Your life I'll display  
In every way.
