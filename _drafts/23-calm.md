still, tranquil

**Scriptures** :

Psa. 37:7 **Be still before Jehovah, and wait for Him** ; / Do not be incensed because of him who enjoys prosperity on his way, / Because of the man who performs his evil schemes.

Psa. 46:10 **Be still and know that I am God.** / I will be exalted among the nations; I will be exalted on earth.

Psa. 131:2 **Surely I have calmed / And quieted my soul** , / Like a weaned child with its mother; / Like a weaned child is my soul within me.

Isa. 30:15a For thus says the Lord Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, / **In returning and rest you will be saved;** / **In**** quietness and in trust will be your strength**.

Luke 10:39 And she had a sister called **Mary, who also sat at the Lord's feet and was listening to His word** . 40 But Martha was being drawn about with much serving, and she came up to Him and said, Lord, does it not matter to You that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to do her part with me. 41 But the Lord answered and said to her, Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things; 42 But there is need of one thing, for **Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her** .

**Footnotes:**

Psa. 131:2, note 1 The psalmist had been weaned, or stripped, of everything except the Lord (cf. Psa. 73). **When we have become like the psalmist, humble, calm, quiet, and weaned, we can advise others to hope in God** (v. 3).

1 Pet. 1:13, note 2 (sober) **Calm and clear in mind, able to realize God's economy in His salvation** , as revealed in vv. 3-12, without being disturbed by fear, anxiety, or any care.

**Ministry Excerpts** :

The Lord prefers His saved ones who love Him to listen to Him (v. 39) that they may know His desire, rather than do things for Him without knowing His will (cf. 1 Sam. 15:22; Ecc. 5:1)… His desire was that His saved ones would listen to Him in order to know what was on His heart… **He wanted those who loved Him to be silent, to sit with Him, to listen to Him, and to concentrate on His speaking…**

In 10:38-42 Martha was very busy in many directions, and she was trying to make the Lord busy. She saw the situation involving the Lord and her sister, Mary. Mary was not doing anything. She was simply sitting at the Lord's feet and listening to His word, and the Lord seemed to appreciate Mary's silence. Today most of the Lord's saved ones are busy trying to serve Him… But those who know the Lord and who know His desire and preference would say, "Don't be so busy… The most precious thing to Him is not that you work for Him or try to do things for Him. **What is most precious to Him is that you sit with Him and silently listen to His word. If you sit with the Lord and listen to His word, you will know His desire and preference."**

While the disciples were on the way to Jerusalem with the Lord, they were busy in such matters as arguing who was greater and in forbidding others to do things for the Lord. In particular, the brothers were busy with their ambition. The sisters, on the contrary, were busy in serving, in ministering. But among the sisters **there was one—Mary—who was not busy. She was calm and sat in silence listening to the Man-Savior's word. As a result, she came to know what was on the Lord's heart** (_Life-Study of Luke_, Ch. 26).

**Everyone who prays should learn to wait on God** . We should never initiate anything by ourselves when we pray. **We need to be calm and wait before God for His instructions and initiation in our prayer** . All good prayers are initiated by God, not by us. When we pray, we must first stop ourselves. Our stopping is to wait on God. There are many who have difficulties in the matter of waiting. Once they cease all activity in the midst of their prayer, their mind becomes more active. We need much exercise in this matter. We need to exercise to the extent that once we kneel down before God, **our whole being is calm and able to wait for His instructions** . When we have God's instruction and initiation, there will be a sense within and a word of burden. We can then start praying according to His inward burden (_Lessons for New Believers,_ Chapter 7).

**Concerning the time for prayer, we should use it properly and be calm before the Lord** . Excited prayer may not cause people to touch spiritual matters; however, this does not mean that we are against excited prayer. We all know from our experience that it is mainly when we are calm that we can touch spiritual reality and the things that are of God in our prayer. If we are in an excited and lively mood, we may suffer more loss than we gain **. Therefore, when we pray together, we should try our best to be calm before the Lord and seek the Lord with a calm spirit** (_The Church as the Body of Christ,_ Chapter 20).

After touching God in our spirit, we must learn the lesson of not opening our mouth quickly. We do not need to shout and cry when we touch God. **We should be silent and calm. The more silent and calm we are, the better** . Many of us cannot pray once we are told to be silent. As soon as we are quiet, our minds wander, and we become confused. We need to shout and cry in order to concentrate. This proves that we have not learned the proper lesson in prayer. We must learn a serious lesson in prayer. **We must turn our entire being away from the outside world. We must stop our entire being and turn to our spirit so that we can appear before God** . The psalmist says that he desires to dwell in the house of Jehovah to behold His beauty (27:4). The house of Jehovah is our spirit. We must turn our entire being to our spirit and remain there silently. This is a matter of practice (_How to Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God_, Chapter 5).

**Tranquility of emotion means that the emotion is able to remain calm** . To be tranquil means to be serene; the two are almost synonymous. It is very easy for one who is emotional to be boiling in his emotions; hence, he must learn to calm his emotions. **To be tranquil in this sense does not mean to be quiet; rather, it means to be calm or settled** . For example, with some, once they hear some joyful news they become too excited and can no longer pray. Not only can they no longer pray, but they cannot even sit still inside the house. This means they do not have a calm emotion. We often think that we are unable to pray because our mind has been disturbed. Actually, it is easy to overcome the disturbance of the mind… But once our emotion is stirred up, it will be very difficult for us to get into our spirit to pray (_Lessons on Prayer,_ Chapter 7).

**One cannot pray if his spirit has no rest and is always in turmoil** . When hearing joyful or sorrowful news, some get very excited in their spirit and cannot calm down. This stimulation, which results from either joy or sorrow, can make one unable to pray. Therefore, we must train ourselves so that whether a situation we encounter is happy or sad, our spirit will not be too excited or stirred up. A spirit cannot pray if it is restless or in turmoil. Seriously speaking, if we are well-trained to pray then we have learned a great deal before the Lord. If the organs of our body need exercise in order to be useful, then, much more, our spirit needs to be exercised in order to function. Prayer requires learning the lessons— especially the lesson of the proper exercise of the spirit. **If you can always maintain a calm and peaceful spirit in any situation or circumstance and with anyone, then you can pray.** (_Lessons on Prayer_, Chapter 5)

**A person who fellowships with God must learn to be quiet. Being quiet is not merely to be freed from the entanglements of outward matters but also to let go of all the things that should not be in our mind, our thoughts. In other words, we need to quiet our mind** . The mind is the most difficult part of a person's inner being to quiet. The young ones and the older ones have many thoughts in the morning when they rise. When a Christian desires to learn to fellowship with God, Satan will work very hard to inject many thoughts into his mind. Sometimes Satan injects thoughts to bother his mind and disturb his inner being. Therefore, **we must first learn the lesson of being quiet so that we can have good fellowship with God. Whenever we come before God, we should not immediately pray, read the Bible, or sing hymns. Rather, we need to settle our being both inwardly and outwardly** . However, we cannot be quiet for too long; otherwise, many scattered thoughts will begin to come in. This will not produce the desired result. Doing anything prior to our time of fellowship will be a distraction, and also being quiet for too long will not be profitable; we need to be balanced (_Lessons for New Believers_, Chapter 22).

**Hymns:**

_ **Hymn 281, s. 4** _

Lord, the Spirit, Peace divine,

Still this restless heart of mine,

Speak to calm this tossing sea,

Stayed in Thy tranquillity.

_ **Hymn 425, ss. 1, 2** _

1Prince of peace, control my will;

Bid this struggling heart be still:

Bid my fears and doubtings cease:

Hush my spirit into peace.

2Thou hast bought me with Thy blood,

Opened wide the gate to God;

Peace I ask, but peace must be,

Lord, in being one with Thee.

_ **Hymn 671, ss. 1, 3** _

1Deep down into the depths of this Thy Name,

My God, I sink and dwell in calm delight;

Thou art enough however long the day,

Thou art enough however dark the night.

3For me Thy trusting one. My God I dare

Once more to fling myself upon Thy breast,

And there adore Thy ways in faith's deep rest,

And there adore Thy ways in faith's quiet rest.

_ **Hymn 643, ss. 3, 4** _

Take time to behold Him,

Be calm in thy soul,

Each thought and each temper

Beneath His control.

Thus led by His Spirit

To fountains of love,

Thou then shalt be fitted

His mercy to prove.

**23 - Calm**
