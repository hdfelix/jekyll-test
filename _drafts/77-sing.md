**Scriptures** :

Psa. 96:1 **Sing to Jehovah a new song; / Sing to Jehovah, all the earth** .

Psa. 96:2 **Sing to Jehovah, bless His name;** / Proclaim His salvation from day to day.

Psa. 98:4 Make a joyful noise to Jehovah, all the earth; / **Break forth, and sing for joy, and sing psalms** .

Psa. 100:2 Serve Jehovah with rejoicing; / **Come before His presence with joyful singing** .

Psa. 146:2 I will praise Jehovah while I live; / **I will sing psalms to my God while I yet have being.**

Psa. 147:7 **Sing unto Jehovah with thanksgiving; / Sing psalms to our God with the lyre** ;

Col. 3:16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, **singing with grace in your hearts to God** .

Eph. 5:19 Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, **singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.**

**Footnotes:**

Psa. 81:41 According to God's ordination Israel, **God's elect, should live a joyful life** (cf. Phil. 4:4). The annual feasts, as well as the sabbatical year and **the year of jubilee, are times of rejoicing, singing, and shouting** (Lev. 23 and 25, and notes).

Eph. 5:191 Verses 19-21 modify be filled in spirit in v. 18. Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are not only for singing and psalming but also for speaking to one another. **Such speaking, singing, psalming, giving of thanks to God (v. 20), and subjecting of ourselves to one another (v. 21) are not only the outflow of being filled in spirit but also the way to be filled in spirit.**

Col. 3:165 **Teaching and admonishing and singing modify the verb dwell** . **This indicates that the way to let the Lord's word dwell in us richly is by teaching, admonishing, and singing** .

Heb. 2:123 This is the firstborn Son's praising of the Father within the Father's many sons in the church meetings. When we, the many sons of God, meet as the church and praise the Father, the firstborn Son praises the Father in our praising. It is not that He praises the Father apart from us and alone; rather, He praises within us and with us through our praising. **In our singing He sings hymns of praise to the Father. If then we do not sing, how can He sing? The more we sing to the Father, the more we enjoy His presence, His moving, His anointing, and His life-imparting within us. Thus we will grow in Him and be brought into His glorification above all** .

**Ministry Excerpts** :

**If an old person such as me can sing this way, you can do even better. Sing in your daily life. Even the more, sing in the meetings. This kind of singing is surely scriptural; it comes from a walk that is according to the Spirit. Even the more, it is an overflow of being filled with God in spirit** (_Key Points on the Home Meetings_, Chapter 3).

**The best way to exercise the spirit is by praying and singing. I encourage you to try it. Keep on praying and keep on singing. The more you pray and the more you sing, the more you exercise your spirit.** The result will be that your spirit will be filled with the Holy Spirit. When you come to the meetings, spontaneously you will speak and sing with psalms and hymns (_Meeting to Speak the Word of God_, Chapter 3).

**We must learn to sing because the more we sing, the more we get out of our mind and forget about our circumstances. The more we sing, the more we are in the spirit and the more our spirit is open and released** . This is not my thought or opinion; this is the thought of the Holy Spirit and the thought of the apostle Paul. In Ephesians 5:18-19, **Paul says that we should be filled in spirit, speaking to one another by singing. If we speak to one another by singing a psalm, hymn, or spiritual song, our spirits will be exercised and the Spirit will come out.** We should not try to sing in a musical way but in a spiritual way. We should even forget about the music, the meter, and the rhyme. I am not a musician or an expert singer; I cannot sing that well. However, **whether I sing well or not, I must sing. We must learn how to praise the Lord by singing.** We need to read, study, and be able to recite some hymns. This way we can sing on the street or in the car. This matter is revealed not only in the New Testament but also in the Old Testament. When the people of Israel came together to worship God in the Old Testament, they sang as they were on their way to Zion (Psa. 133:1-3). If we sing while we are coming to the meeting in the car, the meeting will be in the heavens. **We must learn to exercise and open our spirit by singing** (_The Exercise of Our Spirit for the Release of the Spirit_, Chapter 4).

**We should each have some choruses memorized so that we can sing them all the time in our spirit and with our spirit** . When the young people want to exercise, they often play basketball, baseball, or football. That is the best way for them to exercise their body. However, in order to play, they need a ball. Similarly, **the best way for us to exercise our spirit is to sing, but we need a "ball." We need to have some choruses in us so that we can sing them all the time. Then we must exercise to sing, not merely from our mouth but from our spirit and in our spirit.**

**If we forget about sin and instead sing and praise all the time, we will be in the heavens** , sin will not be able to touch us, and we will have the victory over sin. Many people are seeking to know the Lord's mind and will. **However, if we would sing, the Lord's will would be clear to us in our spirit.** The right way for a Christian to take is to exercise the spirit, contact God, receive the Lord, and express Him. If we have this, we will have everything, including victory over the world, sin, and the self (_The Exercise of Our Spirit for the Release of the Spirit,_ Chapter 4).

**The right way to exercise our spirit is to pray, but sometimes singing a hymn is even better than praying. If we try singing a hymn in the morning, our spirit will be exercised. The more we sing, the more our spirit will be released and strengthened, and the more our mind will be focused, our will subdued, and our emotions purified. Singing in the proper way will deliver us from our natural mind, emotion, and will. This is the best way to be liberated from the things of the natural life. Our singing is a test of whether or not we are in the spirit. If we are in the spirit, we will constantly be singing. Even while we are driving, we will have a song or a hymn with which to praise the Lord. Our singing and praising are a strong testimony to others that we are Christians** (_The Exercise of Our Spirit for the Release of the Spirit,_ Chapter 2).

If we sincerely desire to be saturated with the living Word so that we may live Christ, we need to follow the practice advocated by Paul in Colossians 3:16. This means that **we must let the word of Christ inhabit us in a rich way, not by mere knowledge from the mind, but by every kind of wisdom from our spirit, including singing and psalming.**** Oh, we need to sing and psalm the Word of God! To sing the Word is better than reading it, and to psalm the Word is even better than singing it. Psalming the Word includes musing upon it and enjoying it. As we psalm the Word, we dwell upon it, muse on it, and enjoy it, thereby giving more opportunity for the Word to saturate us**.

If we only read the Word, there is little opportunity for the portion we read to sink into us and saturate our being. **But if we sing the Word, and especially if we psalm it, we open our being more fully to the Word and give it the opportunity to sink into us and saturate us.** For example, if we sing Psalm 1, we shall enjoy the riches found in this short psalm. **Let us sing and psalm the Word of God not only in the meetings. Let us come to the Word daily to sing and psalm it with our whole being. In singing and psalming the Word of God, let us exercise our voice, our mind, our heart, and our spirit** (_Life-study of Philippians,_ Chapter 40).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 305** _

1. I will sing of my Redeemer,And His wondrous love to me;On the cruel cross He suffered,From the curse to set me free.

Sing, oh, sing of my Redeemer,  
With His blood He purchased me,  
On the cross He sealed my pardon,  
Paid the debt, and made me free.

1. I will tell the wondrous story,How my lost estate to save,In His boundless love and mercy,He the ransom freely gave.
2. I will praise my dear Redeemer,His triumphant pow'r I'll tell,How the victory He givethOver sin, and death, and hell.
3. I will sing of my Redeemer,And His heav'nly love to me;He from death to life hath brought me,Son of God with Him to be.

_ **Hymn 1141** _

1. We will sing to the Lord with our spirit,We will sing to the Lord from within,We will sing hallelujah to Jesus;And be blent into oneness with Him.
2. We have been many years in religion,We have been many years in our mind,We have been many years in emotions,Always seeking, but never to find.
3. Now we're learning to turn to our spirit,Now we're learning to take Christ as life;Now we're learning to feed upon JesusAnd be freed from all struggling and strife.
4. Hallelujah for life in the Spirit,Hallelujah for newness within.When we turn from our mind to our spirit,We enjoy all the riches of Him.

_ **Hymn 17 chorus** _

Then all my being sings in praise to Thee,

How marvellous! How great Thou art!

And this I'll sing through all eternity,

How marvellous! How great Thou art!

77 - Sing
