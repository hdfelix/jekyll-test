**Scriptures** :

Job 42:5 I had heard of You by the hearing of the ear, / But now my eye has seen You; 6 **Therefore I abhor myself, and I repent** / In dust and ashes.

Ezek. 18:23 **Do I take pleasure** in the death of the wicked, declares the Lord Jehovah, and not **in his turning away from his ways that he may live** ? 30b â€¦ **Repent, and turn away from all your transgressions** so that iniquity will not become a stumbling block to you.

Matt. 3:2 And saying, **Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near** .

Rev. 2:5a **Remember therefore where you have fallen from and repent and do the first works** .

Rev. 3:3a **Remember therefore how you have received and heard, and keep it and repent** .

**Footnotes** :

Psa. 51:181 Verses 18-19 signify the participation in the enjoyment of God in the local church as God's house, God's dwelling, and in the universal church as God's city, God's kingdom, through the all-inclusive Christ as the offerings. **If we are those who repent, confess our sins, and ask God for His purging (1 John 1:9), we will have the enjoyment of God in Christ in His house, the local church, and in His city, the universal church** . This enjoyment, as the "good" mentioned here, includes God's building up the church, His filling the church with His glory, and His granting the church His rich presence with Himself as joy, peace, life, light, security, and every spiritual blessing (cf. Eph. 1:3).

Ezek. 36:221 (par. 1) In the Lord's recovery by life there are two aspects: the outward aspect, as seen in ch. 34, and the inward aspect, as seen in vv. 22-33 of this chapter. **In the outward recovery we repent, turn to the Lord, and are brought back to the enjoyment of Christ's riches and to God's blessing.** In the inward recovery God touches our heart and our spirit and changes us in life and nature.

Matt. 3:21 **To repent is to have a change of mind issuing in regret, to have a turn in purpose.**

Matt. 3:32 (Prepare) The way, similar to a street, and the paths, similar to lanes, are a portrait of man's heart with all its parts. **To repent unto the Lord with our whole being and with our whole heart and to let the Lord come in is to prepare the way of the Lord.** To allow the Lord to further occupy every part of our heart, including the mind, the emotion, and the will, is to make straight the paths of the Lord. Hence, to prepare the way of the Lord and make His paths straight is to change our mind, to turn our mind toward the Lord and make our heart right, that through repentance every part and avenue of our heart may be straightened by the Lord for the kingdom of the heavens (Luke 1:16-17).

Mark 1:152 **The Greek word means have a change of mind. To repent is to have a change of mind with regret for the past and a turn for the future. On the negative side, to repent before God is not only to repent of sins and wrongdoings but also to repent of the world and its corruption, which usurp and corrupt people whom God created for Himself, and to repent of our God-forsaking life in the past. On the positive side, it is to turn to God in every way and in everything for the fulfillment of His purpose in creating man. It is a "repentance unto God," and is to "repent and turn to God"** (Acts 20:21; 26:20). See notes 21 and 22 in Matt. 3.

2 Pet. 3:97 **Repentance unto salvation (v. 15), which is to repent for not being watchful for the day of the Lord's coming (v. 10) and not living a life in a holy manner and godliness (v. 11).**

Rev 3:191 (zealous) Lit., boiling. Dead, vain knowledge and doctrinal forms have made the degraded recovered church lukewarm. She needs to repent of her lukewarmness and be zealous, boiling, burning, that thereby she may regain the enjoyment of the reality of Christ.

**Ministry Excerpts** :

I hope the Lord will make you clear that the mind is the battlefield and that we need to take the responsibility always to repent, to turn our mind to the Lord. Even when we go to the department store, Satan will utilize many things to attract our mind. **Right away, then, we have to repent, to turn our mind to the Lord. This is the principle that we must apply to our daily life. To repent, to turn our mind to the Lord, is a significant step in constantly being saved. We must learn this. If you would ask me what is the most practical lesson I have learned in all these years, I would say that it is to turn my mind to the Lord all the time** . Much "information" may come to us, with criticism, opposition, and many matters. All these things just attack and distract us from the Lord. We must learn always to turn our mind to the Lord. **In the morning we must repent, at noon we must repent, and in the evening we must repent again. We must repent all the time, and to repent means to turn our mind to the Lord** .

We all have to learn this basic, practical lesson: always to turn our mind to the Lord. Then when our mind is turned to the Lord, it will be renewed. Consider our repentance when we were saved. How much renewing we received just through that one repentance! **The more we repent, the more our mind is renewed; that is, the more we are transformed** . We should forget all the thoughts, arguments, and reasonings. These come from without, from the enemy. We must learn to turn our mind inwardly to the Lord. Then we will meet the Lord; spontaneously our mind will be renewed, and gradually our whole being, our soul, will be transformed. (_Practical Lessons on the Experience of Life_, Chapter 12)

**The repentance called for in chapter three is for the kingdom. You must repent because you are not in the kingdom, because you are not under God's authority. You must repent because you have not yet submitted to the authority of Christ or come under His kingship** . Although you may not feel that you are sinful, as long as you are not in the kingdom, you are a rebellious one. As long as you have nothing to do with the kingship of Christ, you are in rebellion and must repent. Repent of not being in the kingdom! The genuine Christians of today are saved, yet many of them still are not in the kingdom. Thus, even these Christians must repent. **As long as you are not under the kingship of Christ, you must repent** . **If you are not actually in the kingdom of the heavens, not under the heavenly ruling, you must repent.** It does not matter how spiritual, holy, or good you are. The only thing that matters is whether or not you are under the heavenly ruling. If you are not, it means that you are not in the kingdom and that you must repent. If you are not in the kingdom, you are in rebellion. You consider yourself scriptural, fundamental, and holy, but in actuality you are rebellious. Even your spirituality is a form of rebellion against the kingship of Christ. You care for your spirituality, not for the kingship of Christ. This indicates that you are in rebellion, that you are not in the kingdom. Repent of your rebellion! Repent of not being in the kingdom and of not being under the kingship and authority of Christ! This is the basic thought of the Gospel of Matthew.

Do not think that Matthew is only for unbelievers, outsiders, or Gentiles. Many of us have never heard the Gospel of Matthew. I do not know what kind of gospel you have heard, but I do know that you need to hear the Gospel of Matthew, **the Gospel of the kingdom that requires you to repent of not being under the kingship of Christ. We all must repent to the Lord and say, "Lord, forgive me. Even today I am still in rebellion. I am not under Your Lordship, Your authority, Your heavenly ruling. Lord, I confess that I have been ruled only by myself. Lord, grant me a true repentance for my rebellion, for my not being under Your authority." We all need to repent.** (_Life-Study of Matthew_, Chapter 8)

In our study of the Bible we need to pay attention to the background. **John the Baptist came out and said, "Repent!" In actuality, this word may be translated as "have a change of concept," which means to have a change in our thinking and in our philosophy. In Greek, the basic definition of this word is to have a change of mind issuing in regret and thereby to have a turn in purpose; hence, the sense it conveys is stronger and more serious than the common understanding of the word repent.** At that time the Jews, particularly the Pharisees, were filled in their mind with Moses' teachings and laws. They thought about and discussed Moses and the law all day long. This is why John told people to change their concept.

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 1052** _

1I've wandered far away from God,

Now I'm coming home;

The paths of sin too long I've trod,

Lord, I'm coming home.

Coming home, coming home,

Nevermore to roam;

Open wide Thine arms of love;

Lord, I'm coming home.

2I've wasted many precious years,

Now I'm coming home;

I now repent with bitter tears,

Lord, I'm coming home.

1. I'm tired of sin and straying, Lord,

Now I'm coming home;

I'll trust Thy love, believe Thy word;

Lord, I'm coming home.

4My soul is sick, my heart is sore,

Now I'm coming home;

My strength renew, my hope restore:

Lord, I'm coming home.

5My only hope, my only plea,

Now I'm coming home;

That Jesus died, and died for me;

Lord, I'm coming home.

6I need His cleansing blood, I know,

Now I'm coming home;

O wash me whiter than the snow;

Lord, I'm coming home.

_ **Just One Touch of You Dear Lord, s. 4** _

I repent and now return,  
Grant my heart for You to burn.  
Flame in me this zeal.  
Lord, be in me so real!

I repent and now return,  
Grant my heart for You to burn.  
Flame in me this zeal.  
Lord, be in me so real!

Jesus, my first Love! Oh Jesus, my best Love,  
I now return to You.  
Jesus, my first Love! Oh Jesus, my best Love,  
I love You. I just love You!
