treasure, value, precious

**Scriptures** :

S.S 1:13 **My beloved is to me a bundle of myrrh** / That lies at night between my breasts. 14 **My beloved is to me a cluster of henna flowers** / In the vineyards of En-gedi. 16a - **Oh, you are beautiful, my beloved; indeed, pleasant** !

S. S. 2:3 **As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, / So is my beloved among the sons** : In his shade I delighted and sat down, / And his fruit was sweet to my taste.

Luke 7:38 And **she stood behind Him at His feet weeping and began to wet His feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head, and she kissed His feet affectionately and anointed them with the ointment** .

Phil. 3:7 But what things were gains to me, these I have counted as loss on account of Christ. 8 But **moreover I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord** , on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ.

**Footnotes** :

Luke 7:38, note 3 (ointment) Indicating **the woman's appreciation of the Savior's great worth and sweetness** . Even the Savior's feet were precious and sweet to her affection.

Rom 3:22, note 1, par. 2 Faith has an object, and it issues from its object. **This object is Jesus, who is God incarnate. When man hears Him, knows Him, appreciates Him, and treasures Him, He causes faith to be generated in man, enabling man to believe in Him.** Thus, He becomes the faith in man by which man believes in Him. Hence, this faith becomes the faith in Him, and it is also the faith that belongs to Him.

Gal. 2:16, note 1 Lit., faith of Jesus Christ. See note 221 in Rom. 3. **Faith in Jesus Christ denotes an organic union with Him through believing. This**** is related to the believers' appreciation of the person of the Son of God as the most precious One. **The believers are infused with the preciousness of Christ through the gospel preached to them.** This Christ becomes in them the faith by which they believe and the capacity to believe through their appreciation of Him**. This faith creates an organic union in which they and Christ are one.

Gal 5:6, note 3 **Love is related to our appreciation of Christ. Without such an appreciation, faith cannot operate** . **The hearing of faith awakens our loving appreciation** , and the more we love the Lord, the more faith operates to bring us into the riches, the profit, of the all-inclusive Spirit.

**Ministry Excerpts** :

In the Song of Songs, we see one who sought the Lord, and by her seeking, she found Him. Having found Him, she began to have sweet fellowship with Him…. **In her fellowship, first of all, the seeking one had a real appreciation of the Lord. She appreciated the Lord as a bundle of myrrh within and as a cluster of henna flowers without. She sought the Lord, she found the Lord, and in her fellowship with the Lord, she began to appreciate Him. Following this appreciation, there was the enjoyment** —she said that her beloved was like an apple tree. An apple tree is not only for appreciation, but also for enjoyment. First of all, she had the appreciation, and then she came into the enjoyment of eating the fruit of the apple tree under its shadow.

**As we appreciate and enjoy the Lord, something of the element of the Lord is taken into us and eventually becomes us** ….To enjoy the Lord is to eat the Lord, which means that we take something of the Lord into our being. Then, there will not only be the appreciation and the enjoyment, but also the perfuming. To be perfumed means to be permeated with the Lord. **This is why we must appreciate the Lord and begin to enjoy Him. By enjoying Him, something of the Lord will get into us to permeate us** .

**There is only one way to change our mind: by appreciating the Lord. The more we appreciate Him, the more our concept will be changed….Our concepts have been changed by our appreciation of Jesus** . The sweetness and beauty of Jesus have changed our insight. The more we appreciate Him, the more our mind will be changed….From appreciating the Lord, we must go on to enjoy the Lord. The more we take Him in, the more He will be the permeating element within us (_Life and Building as Portrayed in the Song of Songs_, Chapter 7).

**The first step in our experience is not to enjoy the Lord directly, but to appreciate Him….The more we appreciate the Lord's sweetness and fairness, the more our mind will be renewed.** We will lose the view of our natural birth and begin to have the insight of the Spirit (_Life and Building as Portrayed in the Song of Songs_, Chapter 11).

**Real appreciation of the Lord always brings the growth in life and the transformation of life** (_Life and Building as Portrayed in the Song of Songs_, Chapter 5).

The more you use your spirit to contact Him and call, "O Lord Jesus," the more you will sense His supply inwardly. **The more you remember Him, appreciate Him, and consider His glory, beauty, and honor, the more you will be inwardly filled with His Spirit** …. **But the real filling by the Holy Spirit is when we inwardly appreciate and enjoy the Lord Jesus to the uttermost** . **The more you enjoy Him, the more you are filled with Him inwardly. Every day you need to spend some time before Him to open yourselves, to call on Him, and to appreciate Him** . Then you will be filled with the Spirit inwardly. If you do not appreciate Him but still want Him to fill you, it will be impossible. This is why the experienced ones say that the more you praise the Lord Jesus, the more you will be filled with Him; it is really true. This, however, is not an outward skill. **You must truly appreciate Him inwardly and from the depths of your being say, "Lord Jesus, I love You. Lord, You are exceedingly precious** . It is not that I can love You, but it is because You are so lovable." If you do this, He will certainly fill you…. **The best way to be filled by the Lord is to behold and appreciate His beauty. The more you appreciate Him, the more you will be filled by the Holy Spirit** , because the Lord is the Spirit. When you appreciate and love the Lord, He enters into you and fills you as the Spirit (_The Revelation and Vision of God_, Chapter 6).

The **mature saints experience Christ in a detailed way. They understand His thoughts, feelings, and decisions. Those who experience Christ in this way will appreciate the details concerning the Lord's life recorded in the four Gospels** . In their experience, Christ has been cut into pieces, and they appreciate Him in a fine, detailed way. They do not merely experience Christ as a whole in an outward way; they enter, through their cutting Christ into pieces, into the depths of His being (_Life-Study of Leviticus _p. 46-47).

I love Him more today than ever before. As I speak of Him, a fire is burning within me. **The renewing that has taken place in my mind unto full knowledge according to the image of God has created appreciation within me for the Lord. This causes me to love Him** . When we have such a love for the Lord, we shall say, "Lord Jesus, I want to follow You at any cost. I am willing to pay any price, even the price of my life, to be one with You and be for You. Lord, I want to take You as my life and as my person. I want to live You, grow You, and produce You. Lord Jesus, I am here for You and for You alone" (_Life-Study of Colossians _p. 244-245).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 169** _

1Thou, Lord, to God art precious,

His chosen, His delight;

With oil of joy, anointed,

How comely in His sight.

Chorus

We treasure with affection

Thy perfect comeliness,

Thy sweetness and Thy fragrance,

And all Thy loveliness.

2The altogether lovely,

The fairest of the fair,

Thy mouth with grace o'erfloweth;

Our hearts their love declare.

3The wise men offered treasures

And honored Thee at birth;

Thou wast by noble buried,

Still lovable in death.

4Thy head has been anointed,

The lovely One Thou art;

Thy feet anointed also,

Beloved in every part.

5Thy death as myrrh in sweetness

Man's spirit comforteth;

Thy resurrection fragrance

God's longing answereth.

6As henna flow'rs, Thy beauty

In loveliness complete;

As apple trees that flourish,

Thy fruit abundant, sweet.

7Sweet wine Thy love surpasseth,

Thy name an ointment is;

We take Thee as our love feast

And taste the sweetest bliss.

8As on Thyself we ponder

And all Thy beauty trace,

We taste to full Thy sweetness

And rest in Thine embrace.

_ **Hymn 193, s. 1** _

Dear Lord, Thou art so much to us,

Thou art our all in all;

What Thou art fully meets our needs,

Though they be great or small.

Our hearts appreciate what Thou art,

Our spirits worship Thee;

Our grateful praise to Thee we give

As we Thy riches see.

30 - Appreciate
