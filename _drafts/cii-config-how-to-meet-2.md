_Scriptures:_ [1 Cor. 14:26](http://online.recoveryversion.org/BibleVerses.asp?fvid=5560&lvid=5560)
... 
  
This morning we sang one of the top Hymns "Hark ten thousand angels singing..." written by Darby. He translated the Bible and translated the word "church" as the Assemble. This is a literal translation and is correct. The church is the assembly of God's people. We are called by God to assemble. If the church people don't assemble, there is no church [practically]. When they assemble, there is the church [visible]. This shows us how important the meeting life is, our coming together. We can read our Bible in our home, pray, etc. But that is not the church. The church is when we come together; in such a gathering there is a particular expression, testimony. Never despise the meetings of the church. Never consider not meeting! All of our christian life is for the meeting. Without the meeting, our life doesn't have a practical goal or meaning.
  
We saw in the Old testament the picture of the tabernacle among the people of God in the wilderness. This tent raised was called the Tabernacle of Testimony b/c within it was the ark of the Testimony. But the tabernacle was also called the _Tent of Meeting_ because it was the place where the children of Israel would meet. Where we meet is where the testimony of God is. The arrangement of the tribes was around the tent of meeting. The center of their existence was the Tent of Meeting.
  
Similarly today, the church is the center our our daily lives. We gather together and our gathering is the church. The meeting life of God's people therefore is the most important aspect of their lives. We have to be those that think about and live for the meetings. We should be those that come to the meetings and take care of many things; this is God's arrangement.
  
In [Deut. 12](http://online.recoveryversion.org/txo/05_Deuteronomy12.htm) we see that God commanded the children of God to destroy all the worship places of the people that lived in that land. Everything that replaces God is an idol. And idols have their gathering places.Today entertainment has it's gathering places; politics has it's gathering places. We are not here for those things; we are here for God. We also are not here to meet for those other things. The church life is our center and the meeting life is our center. We camp around it; we face our door towards it. We are a different people. God said, "I have chosen a place to put my name there." This place was Jerusalem. In the OT, in the picture, we see what our attitude and actions should be when we come to this place to meet God:
  
* Seek the meetings of the church
* Go to the meetings and gather with the saints
* Bring something - don't show up empty handed; something you have raised, planted, and harvested (the top 10% you have produced). The best is reserved for God (these are the experiences we have enjoyed of God as the good land.) 
* Offer what you bring - we don't come to the meetings to sit, listen, and spectate. If you don't bring an offering, you really are not part of the meeting. What you have seen, enjoyed of Christ, you bring it to the meeting and sing it, psalm it, you speak or pray it. This becomes your offering in the meeting. When we all bring our portion, we have a 'divine buffet'; a meeting full of God's riches. 
  
In the early 80s when I was called to serve the Lord, three things started happening; I got a lot of invitations to (1) Marry people, (2) Bury people, (3) enjoy love feasts. In my experiences, in the love feasts, tthere are large plates and also small plates that took a lot of time to prepare. AS an example, it's not how much or how little you offer but how much time you spent preparing your portion. This is hat feeds people.
  
'Go to the place where I have chosen to put My name.' The Lord says, you have to gather into my name, into my person. That place is God's address. Today, if we want to find God, we should come to the meeting. Where there are two or more gathered in His name, He is there. 
  
In [John 4:24](http://online.recoveryversion.org/FootNotes.asp?FNtsID=2453) we also saw that the time was to come where those who worship God would not do so in a physical place, but "in spirit." God is no longer an objective God but a subjective one. In your worship, you must be gathered to a place that is not physical - your spirit. This is where He has chosen to put His name. The ground of locality, the ground of oneness is important but still physical. We stand on this ground still so that there would not be confusion; but the real meeting place is _our spirit._  Here we have the real oneness of the Spirit. 
  
* In truthfulness
  I'd like to apply this point this morning focusing on _how_ we worship. _In Spirit_ is the place were we worship. _In truthfulness_ is our attitude. In the Old Testament, God was sick and tired of His people b/c they drew near with their lips, but their heart was far away pursuing other things and not the fountain of living waters. We can come to a meeting and sit there, yet our heart is somewhere else following idols. We draw near with our lips - sing a few songs, say a few prayers - but our heart is far off. Do you think God cares for that? I would say, one important thing to make our meeting satisfactory to the Lord and up-to-standard, is to __bring your whole being.__ Bring not just your body, but also your mind, emotions, etc. Bring everything to the meeting. Do you think the Lord would be otherwise happy? If you just show up and then leave, this is _heartless worship._ I'd like to see where there any gathering, whether there are two or three or if there are many, all, down to the last rows, would be in the meeting with their whole heart. "Draw near to Me, seek Me with your whole heart." God hates hypocricy.

Why are we talking about this? Because over the centuries, from the beginning of the church there in Pentecost in the first century, the church has become degraded by the work of God's enemy Satan. One way for him to damage and even destroy the church is to destroy, disrupt, degrade the meetings. By doing so, he degrades the whole church. You can "read" the process of degredation by studying the practice of meetings of the church throughout centuries. The church opened the doors to Judaism, phylosophy, eventually paganistic things. All these things affect the meetings. The church still had to meet but they no longer met as they did in the early church.
  
One of the best places to see how the early church met is to read [Acts 2](http://online.recoveryversion.org/BibleChapters.asp?fcid=91&lcid=91). It says there that they met "continuing steadfastly" in the teaching of the apostles, in the fellowship of the apostles, breaking bread. They met day to day, house to house, continuing steadfastly, together in one accord, breaking bread, eating food, and doing so with exultation and single-heartedness. Here I come back to _truthfulness._ Saints, we have to recover _truthfulness_ in our meetings. There is something fundamental amiss that has caused the meetings to go down. Look at the picture in Acts 2; the first church with it's first meeting. Among other things there is a picture, a portrait here. They met breaking bread every day (not once a week) from house to house. Here you see a picture - people were not meeting b/c the church had a schedule, or being "good christians." They met b/c they love the Lord with all their heart. They aren't just doing a thing carrying out a schedule. Out of their love for the Lord, they were an "enthousiastic bunch of people." When you are in love, you are "head over heels." I see that the saints have lost _enthousiasm_ among the saints. This morning we sang "hark!" and "hail!"; these words mean "Listen!" and a greeting with great enthousiasm. When the President of the US shows up, they play 'Hail the chief'; in our meetings, remember that God is there. Wes hould come with enthousiasm.
  
Before the Lord died, Mary came and broke an alabaster flask of ointment and annointed the Lord's feet. The Lord had told his disciples he would die, so the sisters prepared the spices. But Mary coudln't wait and annointed the Lord before He died. One of the disciples brought 100 pounds later, but he was too late. The point of this story here is the recovery of our best love for the Lord. We may have lost it, like the Church in Ephesus. If we come to the meetings filled with intense enthousiastic love, the meeting will be OK; but if the people that come are half-hearted, luke-warm, the meeting will suffer.
  
Historically the degredation of the christian meeting went so far that the meeting place of the catholics was in a dark place, with eerie music, in a specific building; with one man dressed in a weird way speaking things in a language that no one understood, making signs, crossings, and swinging incense. When you look at such a meeting and compare, you can see how degraded the meetings became. When you look the Protestant meetings, there is still some aspects of those practices b/c protestantism came out of that.
  
In the last 500 years there has been more recovery of the church meeting. In the old way, it is traditions, rituals, the letter of the law, programs, predictable, the same every time, old, dead, and even idolatrous and wordly. The living Person of Christ is missing; there is division, brokenness, etc. The whole thing has been sistematized. The Lord needs a recovery, brothers and sisters. A big part of this is a recovery of the christian meeting. In these places, professionals replace the layman. One replaces thousands. By doing that, the devil successfully stopped the building up of the church. Read [1 Cor. 14](http://online.recoveryversion.org/BibleChapters.asp?fcid=147&lcid=147); we read one verse today. There you will see "let all thigns be done for building up." By dismantling the proper meeeting, Satan successfully stopped the building up of the church. I'd like to impress you with this - What is the meeting for?

###The Church meetings are for building up the church
Wherever there are two or three gathered in the name, that is the church. The meeting is for building. We are all members of the Body. All the gifts given to the church - evangelists, shepherds, teachers, etc. - are for building up the Body. This is God's divine way of building up the Body with _every saint functioning._ Every one functioning in an organic and living way, to a great percentage, in some kind of gathering. It could be 2 or 3; that is a gathering. Even that gathering is for building up.

###How to build up the Church
[1 Cor. 14:16](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=5550&lvid=5550) - "What then brothers, whenever you come together..." it doesn't say here that the priest will bring something or the pastor will bring a sermon and you all sit in your pews. Here it says, "each one has." Do you believe it? Is this the Word of God or not? In our coming together a great part is the offering, eating, rejoicing by each one. Even in the Old Testament, it was _each one._ Even the sisters shoudl bring something to the meetings. The clergy-laity system has killed the portion of each one.
  
In our meetings, we don't need big five start chefs; we are all cooks. Do you think God cares how big your portion is? He cares about how much time you spent on it. You may have a little portion, it may not look so good and it may never get high marks on Yelp. Stop despising your portion! Stop despising what little you feel you may have. What is important that each saint would bring something. The verse says, "Each one has a psalm, teaching, revelation..." The first item mentioned is "a psalm"; psalms are for praising; they could be sung or could simply be read. Psalm 146 -150 are called the "hallelujah psalms" _hallelu_ means praise and _jah_ is Jehovah. The first things we should bring to the meeting is something praise to God (not teaching or truth). I would say that what we are missing the most is this type of praise. Somehow God wants this. Go to Ephesians. Our psalming should include praise, sometimes a melody. Thanking the Father at all times. Do you see this picture? The first thing when we gather is for our heart to be hot, on fire to offer some praise to God. In Hebrews it says we should "offer up the sacrifice of our lips continually, confessing His name." The first thing to offer is praise and thanks. I'd like to see more "Praise the Lord!" and "Hallelujah!" In Acts 2 again, 'praising God and ...'
  
If you feel you have nothing to praise about, consider:
  
* You are still alive
* the good (and 'bad') things; let all complaints be turned into praising Jehovah and giving thanks to the Father. Let our mouths not be filled with some many other things. Replace all thigns with praise. Praise the Lord for all things, especially the bad things. You'll be happy; God will be happy.
* Use the psalms and hymns to help you to praise. The Lord sang a hymn with the disciples at the first table.
* Sing with enthousiasm; not just singing along. 
  By the way, the praising is more important than the melody. I find that so many have become so inhibited that when it calls for some clapping, making noises - "make a joyful noise";

We are below the standard. Even us in the local churches have degraded to a sub-standard level. 

Then a teaching and a revelation. All these three, psalm, teaching, revelation are all done in a prophesying way. To prophesy is to speak Christ, for Christ, and forth Christ. Now in our smaller district meetings, ti should be easier to all prophesy.

"Let all things be done for building up." If you are here to build up the Body, you cannot just sit there. Pray, Lord, break through in me; I cannot be just one sitting there. I'm meeting with your people. I'm worshiping you Lord. But Lord, I am also a builder. I cannot just sit here..

###When we meet we should have:
  
* The Spirit
* The Word
* The Singing
* The Prayer + the speaking

I looked up the meeaning of "Enthousiastic" means to be possessed. Let's not be demon possessed but possessed by the Spirit.

We should be those whose church meetings and daily living blur. They live as they meet; they meet as the live. There is no hypocrisy in them.

Please share something...
