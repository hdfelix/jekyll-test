**Scriptures** :

Matt. 9:21 For she said within herself, **If only I touch His garment, I will be healed** .

Mark 5:30 And immediately Jesus, **realizing in Himself that power had gone out of Him** , turned around in the crowd and said, **Who touched My garments** ?

Matt. 14:36 - And **they begged Him that they might only touch the fringe of His garment. And as many as touched were completely healed** .

Luke 24:39 See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself. **Touch Me and see** , for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you behold Me having.

John 20:27 Then He said to Thomas, Bring your finger here and see My hands, and **bring your hand and put it into My side; and do not be unbelieving, but believing** .

1 John 1:1 That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld and **our hands handled, concerning the Word of life**

**Footnotes** :

Mark 5:30, note 1 (power) The Slave-Savior was God incarnated to be a man (John 1:1, 14). His garments signify His perfect behavior in His humanity—His perfection in His human virtues. **To touch His garments was actually to touch Him in His humanity, in which God was embodied (Col. 2:9). By such a touch His divine power was transfused, through the perfection of His humanity, into the one who had touched Him, and it became her healing. The God who dwells in unapproachable light became touchable in the Slave-Savior through His humanity for her salvation and enjoyment** . This was the service of the Slave-Savior, as the Slave of God, to the sick sinner.

1 John 1:1, note 4 (handled) First, have heard, then have seen; after having seen, beheld, gazed at with a purpose, and handled, touched with hands. **These expressions indicate that the Word of life is not only mysterious but also tangible** , because He was incarnated **. The mysterious Word of life was touched by man, not only in His humanity before His resurrection (Mark 3:10; 5:31) but also in His spiritual body (1 Cor. 15:44) after His resurrection** (John 20:17, 27). At that time there was a heresy that denied the incarnation of the Son of God (4:1-3). Hence, such strong expressions to indicate the Lord's solid substance in His touchable humanity were needed.

Heb 9:14, note 5 This book does not teach religion; rather, it reveals the living God (3:12; 9:14; 10:31; 12:22). **To touch this living God we need to exercise our spirit (4:12) and have a blood-purified conscience in our spirit** .

**Ministry Excerpts** :

The Lord is in His Word, and the Lord Himself is the Word. **A person can touch the Lord in two places—the Word and the Spirit** . The Lord is in the Word, and the Lord is the Word. The Lord is also in the Spirit, and He is the Spirit. We thank Him that we have the Word outside of us and the Spirit inside of us. **We have the Lord's Word in our hand, and we have the Lord's Spirit in our spirit. These are the two places where we can contact the Lord** . Even though the Lord is omnipresent, invisible, and intangible, we can surely locate Him in these two places (_Lessons for New Believers_, Chapter 24).

We must be clear and remember that God is Spirit and that **only the spirit can touch and contact the Spirit** . **Therefore, if we want to contact and touch God in any matter, we must use our spirit** . Apart from our spirit, we cannot touch God in any spiritual matter. (_The Spirit and the Service in the Spirit_, Chapter 3).

**We must first touch God before we can pray. This means that our spirit must touch the Spirit of God.** When we are busy with many outward things, there is no way for us to touch God. When we want to pray, we must free ourselves from all affairs, stop our mental activities, and turn our entire being from outward things to our spirit. **We must learn to exercise our spirit to touch God's Spirit** . Then we will learn to behold God. **Because God is Spirit and dwells in our spirit, it is not difficult to touch Him** . When our entire being is occupied, and we live in our mind, God seems to disappear. However, He has not disappeared; rather, we have turned our backs on Him. We are not beholding Him **. But as soon as we are free from our thoughts and turn from the outward things to our spirit, we touch God immediately. This is to behold God, and this is to touch His presence in our spirit. As soon as we touch God in our spirit, we feel solid within; we feel that we have the anointing and the moving of the Holy Spirit. At this point we can open our mouths to pray** .

We may not find it easy when we begin to practice, and we may need to use the Bible. **If so, we can read through the Bible slowly, allowing God's Word to touch our inward being. We can then turn the words of the Bible into prayer.** In this way, it will be easy for us to be calm and turn to our spirit. Then we will behold God, we will see God; our spirit will contact God, and we will be able to offer genuine prayers. **As we utter such prayers, we still need to pay attention to the matter of touching God.** Once we stop touching God, we should not force ourselves to pray. We should, rather, continue reading the Word. We should use the Bible as a support to help us enjoy God through prayer. **When we are calm and can touch our spirit through reading the Word, we can start praying again** . In short, we do not need to force ourselves to pray whenever our spirit is dry and we cannot touch God. If we force ourselves, our spirit will receive no benefit but may actually be harmed. We should rather stop our prayer and continue reading the Word.

**The only prayers that touch God are those offered in the Spirit. Only through such prayers can we receive God.** We should pray in this way, not only in the morning when we contact God but also in our time of prayer during the day. We should always feel the watering, anointing, and divine presence while we pray. But **if we feel dry and void of God while we pray for a particular matter, we should stop praying and change the direction or subject of our prayer until we touch God** . Then we can continue praying. In this way we can remain in the spirit while we pray (_How to Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God_, Chapter 19).

When we pray, we must learn to turn to our spirit. We must learn to set aside our feelings, opinions, ideas, memory, and decisions and **pray solely according to the feeling in our spirit…The more we pray, the more we touch God's presence and the more we absorb God Himself.** The more we pray, the more we are filled with God. This is to enjoy God. The matters in our petitions are secondary. The important thing is that we have reached God, gained God, and absorbed God. This should be our experience every time we pray…. **Whenever we pray, our prayers should be inward prayers that come from touching God** (_How to Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God_, Chapter 20).

**Whenever we touch God and live in His countenance, we will see that we are dirty and full of sins** . We will also realize that our person, which is of the old creation, is a big frustration to God. At such times we will immediately apply the blood and say, "Lord, cleanse me with the blood. Cleanse me with the blood." … **Whenever we touch our spirit, and whenever we touch God and sense His presence and mingling, we will realize that we are unclean** . Even if we spend one hour praying for cleansing, we will still need the cleansing of the blood in the next hour. Only when we touch God can we discover, realize, and see our filthiness. A believer once said, "Even my tears of repentance require the cleansing of the blood." We need to repent even for our repentance for sins. **I can testify that the more one touches God's presence and His countenance, and the more one mingles with God and cooperates with Him, the more he feels a need for the cleansing of the blood** (_How to__Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God_, Chapter 4).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 559** _

1.Savior, I by faith am touching

Thee, the source of every good;

Virtue now, by faith am claiming,

Through the cleansing of Thy blood.

Touching Thee, new life is glowing

By Thy Spirit's burning flame;

Cleansing, purging, Spirit filling,

Glory to Thy Holy Name!

2.Touching Thee in faith, I take Thee

In Thy riches full and free;

All I am I open to Thee,

All Thou art Thou giv'st to me.

3.Touching now Thine outstretched scepter,

O most mighty King of kings;

Of Thy fulness now receiving,

High I mount on eagle wings.

4.Grace and virtue, strength and wisdom,

All my need, by Thee supplied;

Keep me touching, keep me claiming,

Keep me ever at Thy side.

_ **Hymn 769, ss. 1-2, 5-7** _

1To the holiest place I'd come,

There within the veil to be;

There to touch the throne of grace,

Let life's water flow thru me.

2Now the holiest place of all

Right within my spirit is;

Here the Lord in me abides,

And my spirit joins with His.

5If in spirit Him I touch,

With His riches filled I'll be;

Life and light and love and grace

As a stream will flow thru me.

6Touching deeply, richly I

Of Himself experience,

Thus the law of life I touch

And His clear anointing sense.

7In my spirit deeper still

I would touch the Lord I love,

Touch Him in His hidden depth

And His hidden manna prove.
