**Scriptures** :

Zech 10:1 - **Ask rain of Jehovah / At the time of spring rain** , / Of Jehovah who makes the lightning, / And He will give them showers of rain, / To everyone herbage in the field.

Luke 11:9 And I say to you, **Ask and it shall be given to you** ; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you. 10 **For everyone who asks receives** , and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it shall be opened. 11 But what father among you whose son shall **ask for a fish** will instead of a fish hand him a snake? 12 Or if he shall also **ask for an egg** will hand him a scorpion? 13 If you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children, **how much more will the Father who is from heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!**

John 4:10 Jesus answered and said to her, **If you knew the gift of God and who it is who says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water** .

John 14:13 And **whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.**

John 15:7 **If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you** . 16 You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I set you that **you should go forth and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain, that**** whatever you ask the Father in My name, He may give you**.

John 16:23 And in that day you will ask Me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, **Whatever you ask the Father in My name, He will give to you.** 24 Until now you have asked for nothing in My name; **ask and you shall receive, that your joy may be made full.**

1 John 5:14 And this is the boldness which we have toward Him, that **if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us** . 15 And if we know that He hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests which we have asked from Him.

**Footnotes**** :**

Zech 10:1, note 1 Rain here signifies blessing. **Here the Lord encourages His people to ask Him for His abundant blessing at the time when He is favorable toward them.**

Exo 17:6, note 3, par. 2 To drink of the water of life, we first need to be positioned to drink (1 Cor. 12:13), and we also need to be thirsty (John 7:37; Rev. 21:6). **Then we need to come to the Lord (John 7:37; Rev. 22:17), to ask of the Lord (John 4:10), to believe in the Lord (John 7:38), and to call on the name of the Lord (Isa. 12:3-4; Acts 2:21).**

Ezek 36:37, note 1 (inquired) **The Lord promised to increase our number with men like a flock, but we need to pray for this and ask Him to do it** (cf. Luke 10:2).

Matt 6:8, note 1 Although God our Father knows our need, **we still must ask Him, because he who asks receives** (7:8).

John 15:7, note 2 **When we abide in the Lord and let His words abide in us, we actually are one with Him,** and He works within us **. Then, when we ask in prayer for whatever we will, it is not only we who are praying; He too is praying, in our praying.** This kind of prayer is related to fruit-bearing (v. 8) and will surely be answered.

**Ministry Excerpts** :

Suppose that there are many things here. Which one do you want? You must ask for at least one thing. You cannot say that anything will do. **God wants to know what you specifically want and what you specifically are asking for. Only then can He give it to you. Hence, to ask means to demand something specific. We have to ask** .

A new believer needs to learn to pray. He needs to pray with a specific goal in mind. "You do not have because you do not ask" (James 4:2). **Many people go through the motion of prayer without asking for anything. It is useless to spend an hour or two hours or even eight or ten days before the Lord without asking for anything. You need to learn to ask for something** ; you need to knock, really knock hard, at a door. Once you clearly identify the entrance and seek to go in, knock hard at the door. When you seek something specific, you will not be satisfied with just anything; you want that particular thing. (_New Believers Series: Prayer #11_, Chapter 1)

Are you here to ask the Lord to do something for you? Do you have a temper which plagues you? Have you come for the Lord to liberate you? Are you defeated by your love for the world? Do you have dozens or even hundreds of other sins that you are not able to overcome? If your thoughts are unclean, if you cannot overcome your disposition, if you do not have an uninterrupted fellowship with the Lord, if you are afraid to pray, or if you see no result to your work, **now is the time for you to ask the Lord to give you the abundant life and fill you up with the Spirit. If you ask of the Lord, He will bless you abundantly, and the Spirit will fill you up.** (_Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 41_: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (1), Chapter 12)

**We do need to ask God to show us that His facts are facts** . Whenever we have the inner revelation, we can spontaneously believe and then spontaneously have the experience. We say again that we may indeed inquire of God, but **what we need to ask Him for is the enlightening of our eyes to give us revelation and light that we may really see something concerning God's facts** .

Therefore, we strongly emphasize again that concerning God's fact we do not need to ask God to do that thing again; **we need only ask God to show us that He has already done that thing** . We need not ask God to put us now into Christ, but **we do need to ask God to show us that He has already put us into Christ** . We do not need to ask God to crucify our old man, but **we do need to ask God to show us that He has crucified us with Christ** . Neither are we asking God to pour down the Holy Spirit from the heavens; rather, **we are asking God to show us that the Holy Spirit has already been poured down** . (New Covenant, The (1952 Edition), Chapter 1)

We should not consider the vision of the great mystery of the church to be a small matter. **We need to seriously look to the Lord so that whenever we have a slight sense within, we would ask the Lord to retain that sense for us; whenever we have a slight comprehension and seeing,**** we would ask the Lord to retain and magnify the light**. We need to tell the Lord, "Lord, this is the dawning light; this is the sun rising up in the morning. I do not want this sun to set; I want this light to shine brighter and brighter until the full day." If the brothers and sisters are willing to do this, many of them will be enlightened, seeing and understanding what the Body of Christ is in this age. (_The Church as the Body of Christ,_ Chapter 11)

**In learning to follow the guidance of the Spirit, we have to ask what the Spirit is saying before we ask what the Bible is saying.**** The first thing we should ask is what the inner registration is telling us**. However, most people today first ask what the Bible says and do not ask what the Spirit within says. This is not normal. A New Testament believer has the Holy Spirit residing within. This is a precious thing. We have to learn to know the inner leading of the Holy Spirit within us. (_Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 41:_ Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (1), Chapter 26)
