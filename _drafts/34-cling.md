hold, embrace, cleave

**Scriptures** :

Deut. 13:4 You shall follow Jehovah your God; and you shall fear Him, keep His commandments, listen to His voice, serve Him, and **hold fast to Him** .

Josh. 23:8 **But you shall cling to Jehovah** your God, as you have done to this day.

Psa. 119:31 **I cling to Your testimonies** ; / O Jehovah, do not put me to shame.

S. S. 3:4 Scarcely had I passed them / When I found him whom my soul loves; / **I held him and would not let go** / Until I had brought him into my mother's house / And into the chamber of her who conceived me.

Luke 8:15 But that which is in the good earth, these are those who in a noble and good heart **hear the word and hold it fast and bear fruit with endurance** .

Phil. 3:12 Not that I have already obtained or am already perfected, but I pursue, if even **I may lay hold of that for which I also have been laid hold of by Christ Jesus** .

**Footnotes**** :**

Hab 1:1, note 1, par. 1 **(Habakkuk) Meaning embracing, or clinging to** . The meaning of the prophet's name indicates that in order for sinners to receive God's eternal salvation (2:4), which is actually God Himself (Isa. 12:2; Luke 2:30), **God became a man on the earth that He might embrace sinners and sinners might cling to Him** (cf. Luke 19:1-10). See note 41 in ch. 2 and note 41 in Hosea 11.

S.S. 3:4, note 1 **After finding her Beloved, she holds Him and will not let go until she brings Him into the Spirit of grace** , through which she was regenerated (her mother's house and chamber), for secret fellowship. She was born in the mother's house and was conceived in the mother's chamber. The mother is grace (Gal. 4:26, 31 and note 311), and the mother's chamber signifies love, which is of the Father and which issues in grace (Eph. 2:4-5). The Spirit brings God's love and carries God's grace to us (2 Cor. 13:14 and note 1, pars. 1 and 2); hence, He is called the Spirit of grace (Heb. 10:29). Although the lover of Christ fell into introspection, one day she woke up and realized that, though she was a sinner, she was saved by grace (Eph. 2:8). This revived her.

Phil. 3:12, note 7 At his conversion Paul was grasped, taken possession of, by Christ in order **that he might grasp, take possession of, Christ. Christ gained him that he might gain Christ** (v. 8).

**Ministry Excerpts:**

In verse 4 [Deuteronomy 13] Moses continued, "You shall follow Jehovah your God; and you shall fear Him, keep His commandments, listen to His voice, serve Him, **and hold fast to Him." Instead of using the expression "hold fast to Him," we today may speak of laying hold on Christ. We all need to lay hold of, to hold on to, Christ** (_Life-Study of Deuteronomy_, Chapter 12).

We have no right to divorce the Lord; we have no basis to forsake Him. **We must take Him, love Him, honor Him, respect Him, regard Him, exalt Him, and cling to Him, rejecting Satan to the uttermost. Then we will be blessed** (_Life-Study of Joshua, Judges & Ruth_, Chapter 21).

In verse 31 [Psalm 119] **the psalmist said to God, "I cling to Your testimonies." We also need to cling to the word of God** (_Life-Study of Psalms_, Chapter 40).

The name Habakkuk in Hebrew means "embracing" or "clinging to," signifying that **we need to seek God by embracing Him or clinging to Him** . For us to receive God's eternal salvation, we need to be embraced by God, and we need to cling to Him. Eternal salvation is actually God Himself. God does not save us by remaining in the heavens and stretching out His arm to reach the earth. In order to save us, God became a man on this earth and came to us. The central thought of the four Gospels is that **the saving God came out of eternity into time, out of the heavens to earth, and out of divinity into humanity to be a man. In this way He could embrace man and man could cling to Him** . While God was saving us, He was not in the appearance, the form, of God. Rather, He was in the form of a man named Jesus. Hosea 11:4 tells us that God draws us with the cords of a man, with the bands of love. The saving cords of love are Christ's humanity. The account of Zaccheus in Luke 19:1-10 shows us the way God saves us by coming to us. **In order to be saved by God, we must be embraced by God and we must cling to Him** (_Life-Study of the Minor Prophets_, Chapter 27).

[Luke 16:] 13 continues, "No household servant can serve two lords; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will cleave to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon." In this verse the Greek word for "serve" means "serve as a slave." **Here the Lord indicates that to serve Him requires us to love Him, giving our hearts to Him, and cleave to Him, giving our entire being to Him** (_Life-Study of Luke,_ Chapter 36).

The Greek word means to secure, to obtain, to lay hold of. In [Phil 3:] 12 Paul uses two other words which mean "obtain" and "lay hold of." Thus, he speaks of gaining, obtaining, and laying hold of Christ. **To lay hold means to grasp or to take possession. Paul's desire was not only to gain Christ, but also to obtain Him and even lay hold of Him** (_Life-study of Philippians_, Chapter 52).

**In Philippians 3 Paul uses three Greek words that are rendered gained, obtained, and laid hold of. The meaning of these words is very close, for to obtain is to gain, and to gain is to lay hold of. The strongest of these expressions is lay hold of. Christ has laid hold of us that we might lay hold of Him. He has gained us that we might gain Him. Thus, the Christian life is a life of gaining Christ.** How much have you gained of Christ? This is a crucial question. We grow in life by gaining Christ. The degree to which we have gained Christ is the degree to which we have grown with Christ. We all need to gain Christ in order to grow in life. Spiritual growth is measured by how much we have gained of Christ….Gaining Christ is a lifelong matter. Day by day our goal should be to gain Him. Even during his imprisonment, Paul was pursuing Christ in order to gain Him (_Life-study of Philippians_, Chapter 23, pp. 192-193).

In verses 13 and 14 Paul goes on to say, "Brothers, I do not yet reckon myself to have laid hold, but one thing—forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, I pursue toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus." Even though Paul had experienced and gained Christ tremendously, he did not consider that he had experienced Him in full or gained Him to the uttermost. For this reason he was still advancing toward the goal—the gaining of Christ to the fullest extent. We should not be satisfied simply with Bible knowledge, not even with the knowledge of Philippians 3. We need to have the actual pursuing of Christ. The Greek word for pursue can also be translated persecute. Before Paul was saved, he was persecuting Christ in a negative way. After he was saved, he pursued Christ to such an extent we may even say he persecuted Christ, but in a very positive way. **To persecute a person is to trouble him and refuse to let him go. Before Paul was saved, he bothered Christ and would not let Him go, persecuting Him negatively. But after he was saved and had been gained by Christ, he still persecuted Him, but positively, for he refused to let Christ go. We also should persecute Christ in this way** . **This is to pursue Christ in order to gain Him. Do not let Christ go** . Bother Him, persecute Him, in order to gain Him. To persecute Christ in this way is exhausting. As we persecute Christ, we should spend ourselves completely. Our whole being with all of our strength should be consumed in pursuing Christ. I hope that many among us will be impressed with the need to pursue Christ and be stirred up to seek Him even in a persecuting way. **Do not allow Christ to get away from you, but seek Him, pursue Him, persecute Him in such a positive way. Then you will gain Him** (_Life-study of Philippians_, Chapter 23, p. 198).

**Hymns** :

_ **Pursue Him and know Him** _

1Pursue Him and know Him; be found in Him.

Count all things loss for Him.

Just gain Him, obtain Him; lay hold of Him.

It's Christ the central vision.

Forgetting the things which are behind,

Press on, pursue with this mind.

By any means each hour now redeem;

Stretch forth, lay hold of Him.

2Pursue Him and seize Him, Christ the supreme.

Just love this precious Person.

Forgetting and leaving all other things,

Love Him with your whole being.

3Christ now is my center and reality,

My life for eternity.

All things are just dung compared to Him,

So love and just gain Him!

_ **Hymn 451** _

1Not by wrestling, but by clinging

Shall we be most blest;

Wrestling only brings us sorrow;

Clinging brings us rest.

2 When we stay our feeble efforts,

And from struggling cease,

Unconditional surrender

Brings us God's own peace.

3Lean we all our weight on Jesus,

Who alone can save;

He by might of love hath triumphed

O'er His willing slave.

4Yielding, we shall know true conquest;

Dying, we shall live;

"Not my will, but Thine" prevaileth,

Victory to give.
