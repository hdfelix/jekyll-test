lowly

**Scriptures** :

2 Chron. 7:14 **And My people, who are called by My name, humble themselves and pray and seek My face and turn from their evil ways; then I will hear from heaven and forgive their sin and heal their land** .

Prov. 3:34 To scorners He is scornful, / **But to the humble He gives grace.**

Isa. 57:15 For thus says the high and exalted One, / Who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: / **I will dwell in the high and holy place, / And with the contrite and lowly of spirit, / To revive the spirit of the lowly / And to revive the heart of the contrite** .

Matt. 18:4 **He therefore who will humble himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens** .

Luke 18:13 But the tax collector, standing at a distance, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be propitiated to me, the sinner! 14 I tell you, This man went down to his house justified rather than that one; **for everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, but he who humbles himself shall be exalted** .

Phil. 2:3 Doing nothing by way of selfish ambition nor by way of vainglory, **but in lowliness of mind considering one another more excellent than yourselves;** 4 Not regarding each his own virtues, but each the virtues of others also. 5 **Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus** , 6 Who, existing in the form of God, did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped, :7 But emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men; 8 And **being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death** , and that the death of a cross.

1 Pet. 5:5 In like manner, younger men, be subject to elders; **and all of you gird yourselves with humility toward one another, because God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble** . 6 **Therefore be humbled under the mighty hand of God that He may exalt you in due time** .

**Footnotes** :

Lev. 14:91 The hair of the head signifies man's glory in self-display; the beard, man's self-assumed honor; the eyebrows, man's excellencies, merits, and virtues issuing from his natural birth; and all the hair of the body, man's natural strength and ability. **The shaving off of all the hair and the bathing in water equal getting rid of the self with all its glory, honor, excellencies, merits, virtues, strength, and ability through the "razor" of the cross. When we have nothing and are nothing, we shall be clean** (cf. Phil. 3:7-11).

Psa. 128:11 …Because Israel, like their persecutors and haters, has many sins and iniquities, Psa. 130 is a psalm of forgiveness and redemption. **Then Psa. 131 indicates that after we experience God's forgiveness, we become humble and quiet before God. In such a situation God can rise up, enter into us, and take us as His resting place.** This is Zion becoming God's habitation, His resting place, as revealed in Psa. 132….

Psa. 131:21 The psalmist had been weaned, or stripped, of everything except the Lord (cf. Psa. 73). **When we have become like the psalmist, humble, calm, quiet, and weaned, we can advise others to hope in God** (v. 3).

Matt. 7:12 **The kingdom people, living in a humble spirit under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, always judge themselves, not others** .

1 Pet. 5:61 **In Greek the word is in the passive voice, indicating being made humble by God, mainly through sufferings in persecution (v. 10). This, however, requires that we cooperate with God's operation; we must be willing to be made humble, lowly, under the mighty hand of God. Hence, be humbled. Humbled is passive, but be is active. While God is acting to operate on us, we need to take the initiative to be operated on by Him** . To take the initiative is active; to be operated on is passive. This is our willingness to be under the hand of God, which is mighty to do everything for us.

**Ministry Excerpts** :

But if we are poor in our spirit, we are blessed. **To be poor in spirit is not only to be humble, but also to be emptied in our spirit** , in the depth of our being, not holding on to the old things of the old dispensation, but unloaded to receive the new things, the things of the kingdom of the heavens. We need to be poor, emptied, unloaded, in this part of our being so that we may realize and possess the kingdom of the heavens. This implies that the kingdom of the heavens is a spiritual matter, not a material one (_Life-Study of Matthew,_ Chapter 13).

I have had this experience many times, realizing that I am nothing, that I have nothing, and that I can do nothing. **When our heart is humbled and our soul is quiet, we are in a condition that is suitable for God to come in to rest. In such a situation God can have a resting place, a dwelling** . However, when we are proud and our eyes are haughty, God has no rest, no dwelling place, in us. **Only when we are humble, calm, and quiet is the situation right for God to rise up, enter into us, and take us as His resting place** . This is Zion becoming God's habitation, His resting place, as revealed in Psalm 132 (_Life-Study of Psalms,_ Chapter 42).

**I would like to emphasize the fact that in [1 Peter 5:] 6 Peter tells us to "be humbled."**** We cannot make ourselves humble. Rather, we need to be made humble by God. Nevertheless, God's humbling of us requires our cooperation with God's operation. This means that we must be willing to be made humble, lowly, under the mighty hand of God. We may say that "be humbled" is active-passive: "be" is active, pointing to our initiative to be humbled, and "humbled" is passive, pointing to God's operation to humble us. Although God's hand is mighty to do whatever is necessary for us, His hand still needs our cooperation. God's operation needs our cooperation. Therefore, we need to be humbled** (_Life-Study of 1 Peter,_ Chapter 33).

**What does it mean for us to say that humility is just the Lord Himself? It means that I do not have any humility and I cannot be humble. Even if the Lord gives me the strength to humble myself, I still cannot be humble. I can only say to the Lord, "You are my humility. I allow You to become my humility."** Brothers and sisters, what is the meaning of Christ becoming my humility? Simply put, it means that Christ replaces me and expresses His own humility in my place. When we ask God for power to humble ourselves, we may be able to humble ourselves for a while, but this humility is merely good behavior, a good attitude, a good intention, and a good condition. This humility is not Christ. When we ask the Lord to be our humility, we lift up our heads and say to Him, "Lord, I do not have any humility in me. Even if You give me the strength to humble myself, I still would not have humility. **Therefore Lord, I ask that You come and be my humility and that You be humble in my place." After we look to the Lord this way, any humility that we begin to have will be a spontaneous humility. Such humility will not be a work, but a living person—Christ Himself** (_Christ Becoming Our Wisdom,_ Chapter 1).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 1054** _

1. Pass me not, O gentle Savior,Hear my humble cry;While on others Thou art calling,Do not pass me by.

Savior, Savior,  
Hear my humble cry;  
While on others Thou art calling,  
Do not pass me by.

1. Let me at Thy throne of mercyFind a sweet relief;Kneeling there in deep contrition,Help my unbelief.

1. Trusting only in Thy merit,Would I seek Thy face;Heal my wounded, broken spirit,Save me by Thy grace.

1. Thou the spring of all my comfort,More than life to me;Whom have I on earth beside Thee?Whom in heaven but Thee?

_ **Hymn 411** _

1Bless'd are the pure in heart,  
For they shall see our God;  
The secret of the Lord is theirs,  
Their heart is Christ's abode.

2The Lord, who left the heavens,  
Our life and peace to bring,  
To dwell in lowliness with men,  
Their pattern and their King.

3He to the lowly soul  
Doth still Himself impart,  
And for His dwelling and His throne  
Chooseth the pure in heart.

4Lord, we Thy presence seek;  
May ours this blessing be;  
Give us a pure and lowly heart,  
A temple meet for Thee.
