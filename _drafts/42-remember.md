**Scriptures** :

Deut. 5:15 And **you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt and that Jehovah your God brought you out from there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm** ; hence, Jehovah your God commanded you to hold the Sabbath day.

Psa. 63:6 **When I remember You while on my bed,** / When I consider You in the night watches.

Psa. 77:11 **I will bring to remembrance the deeds of Jehovah** , / For I will remember Your wonders from of old.

Psa. 119:55 **I have remembered Your name / In the night, O Jehovah** , / And have kept Your law.

John 16:4 But **these things I have spoken to you that when their hour comes you may remember them** , that I told you of them. Now these things I have not said to you from the beginning, because I was with you.

2 Pet. 1:15 Moreover I will also be diligent that you may be able, after my exodus, **to bring these things to mind at all times.**

2 Pet. 3:2 **So that you would remember the words** spoken before by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior preached by your apostles.

**Ministry Excerpts**** :**

Psalm 119:132 says, "Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name." This verse indicates that the psalmist loved the Lord's name. **Verse 55 says, "I have remembered thy name, O Jehovah, in the night, and have kept thy law" (Heb.). When the psalmist awoke during the night, he remembered the Lord's name. What we remember in the night reveals our true interest, even the thing that occupies us. What do you think of when you wake up at night? If you are one who seeks God, you will remember His name** . His name will be your special interest. Young people, I hope that when you awake during the night, you will not dwell on worldly things, but will remember the sweet, precious name of the Lord. **Like the Old Testament saints, may we all love the Lord's name and remember it, even in the middle of the night** . (_Life-Study of Exodus,_ Message 56, pp. 658-659)

In Paul's word about shadows we have a hint as to how we may enjoy Christ in a practical way. **Since such things as eating and drinking are shadows of which Christ is the substance and reality, we need to be reminded whenever we eat and drink that the real food and the real drink are Christ** . When you eat your food, you should simultaneously eat Christ. When you drink some beverage, you should also drink Christ. As you put on your clothing, you should be reminded that Christ is the real clothing, and you should experience Him as such. As you put on your material clothing, you should also put on Christ. It is easy to enjoy Christ in this way. **Whatever we do day by day should remind us of Christ as the reality of that thing. Even our breathing should remind us of the necessity of breathing Christ spiritually** .

If we follow the practice of taking Christ as the reality of all the material things in our daily life, our daily walk will be revolutionized and transformed. It will be full of Christ. When we eat and drink, we shall take Christ as our spiritual food and drink. **Everything we do will remind us to contact Christ, to enjoy Christ, to experience Christ, and to have Christ as our everything. To practice this day by day is truly to enjoy Christ** . (_Life-Study of Colossians_, Message 55, p. 485)

We are rooted in Christ, who is the rich, fertile soil. Having been rooted in Him, we should go on to absorb His riches. As a tree absorbs nourishing elements from the soil through its roots, we also should absorb the riches of Christ into us. The elements absorbed into a tree from the soil enable the tree to grow. Thus, a tree's growth depends upon the nourishment it absorbs through its roots. **Since we have been rooted into Christ, we should remain in Him in a practical way day by day. In our experience, we need to stay rooted in Christ. However, if we forget Christ in matters such as eating and drinking, we are not rooted in Him in our experience. When we eat our food, we may not remember Christ** . After our meal, we may spend some time in prayer. But even at the beginning of our prayer, we may not actually and experientially be rooted in Christ, for we may pray many unnecessary things. But in His mercy and patience, the Lord waits until we begin to pray in a genuine way. Then in our experience we absorb Christ's riches. However, when our time of prayer is finished, it may happen that we do not go on to assimilate what we have absorbed of Him. According to the Lord's words in John 15, it could be that we do not abide in Him. (_Life-Study of Colossians_, Message 55, p. 486)

**We should not only absorb the Lord in the morning, but we should be like trees continually absorbing the riches of the soil. This means that we must learn to practice the continual enjoyment of Christ. We should let every physical thing be a reminder of Christ, for all these things are shadows of which Christ is the substance. The clothing we put on each day should remind us of Christ. We should put Him on in our spirit and by our spirit. Drinking a glass of water should remind us to drink Christ by the exercise of our spirit. To follow this practice is to be rooted in Christ and to absorb His riches** . (_Life-Study of Colossians_, Message 55, p. 487)

**It is by eating, drinking and enjoying the Lord that we remember Him** . The following stanza of Hymns, #233 speaks of this:

We long to eat and drink e'en more,

To take Thyself in spirit thus,

Till Thou shalt all our being fill

And true remembrance have from us.

**The more we eat, drink, and enjoy Him, the more we render Him the true remembrance** . To remember the Lord is not merely to recall that Christ is God who became a man, lived as a carpenter, and was persecuted, arrested, judged, and crucified. Rather, to remember Him is to eat and drink Him, to enjoy Him. In other words, we do not remember the Lord by using our mind to meditate about the Lord; instead, **we remember the Lord by exercising our spirit to feed on Him. Our remembering the Lord in such a way declares to the whole universe that we daily enjoy Him as our food and drink** . He is our feast, our enjoyment. (_The Conclusion of the New Testament_, Message 312, pp. 3169-3170)

**Hymns:**

_ **Hymn 86** _

1Though Thou art God, most glorious, high,

Thou in the flesh to us came nigh,

A lowly man become thereby;

Lord, I remember Thee!

2Glory divine was put away

Under the tent of flesh to stay,

No outward beauty to display;

Lord, I remember Thee!

3Thou art a root from out dry ground,

Thou wast the Man of sorrows found,

Hated, despised by man around;

Lord, I remember Thee!

4Gentle and lowly is Thy heart,

Willing to suffer all Thou art,

To God and man complaining not;

Lord, I remember Thee!

5Thou as a man art tender, sweet,

Balanced in every way, complete,

Meal-offering to the Father meet;

Lord, I remember Thee!

6Doing the Father's will Thy prize,

Never accepting Satan's lies,

None like Thyself, so faithful, wise;

Lord, I remember Thee!

7For Thine obedience to God's will,

Willing to suffer deathly ill,

E'en on the Cross my place to fill,

Lord, I remember Thee!

8Therefore hath God exalted Thee,

Given Thee glory, majesty,

Heaven and earth will bow the knee;

O Lord, I worship Thee!

_ **Hymn 214** _

1. According to Thy gracious word,In meek humility,This will I do, my dying Lord,I will remember Thee.
2. Thy body, broken for my sake,My bread from heaven shall be;Thy testamental cup I take,And thus remember Thee.
3. Gethsemane can I forget?Or there Thy conflict see,Thine agony and bloody sweat,And not remember Thee?
4. When to the cross I turn mine eyesAnd rest on Calvary,O Lamb of God, my sacrifice,I must remember Thee-
5. Remember Thee and all Thy painsAnd all Thy love to me;Yea, while a breath, a pulse remains,I will remember Thee.
6. And when these failing lips grow dumbAnd mind and memory flee,When Thou shalt in Thy kingdom come,Jesus, remember me.
