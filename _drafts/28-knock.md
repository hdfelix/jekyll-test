**Scriptures** :

Luke 11:9 And I say to you, Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find; **knock and it shall be opened to you** .

10 For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and **to him who knocks it shall be opened.**

Luke 18:1 And He told them a parable to the end that they ought always to pray and not lose heart,

2 Saying, There was a certain judge in a certain city who did not fear God and did not regard man.

3 **And there was a widow in that city, and she kept coming to him** , saying, Avenge me of my opponent.

4 And for a time he would not; but afterward he said within himself, Even though I do not fear God nor regard man,

5 **Yet because this widow causes me trouble, I will avenge her, lest by continually coming she wear me out** .

6 And the Lord said, Hear what the unrighteous judge says.

7 **And will not God by all means carry out the avenging of His chosen ones, who cry to Him day and night** , though He is long-suffering over them?

8 I tell you that He will carry out their avenging quickly. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?

**Footnotes**** :**

Mat 7:7, note 1 **First ask, then seek, and last knock.** To ask is to pray in a common way, to seek is to supplicate in a specific way, and **to knock is to demand in the most intimate and most earnest way.**

**Ministry Excerpts** :

**To ask is to pray in a common way, to seek is to pray in a specific way, and to knock is to pray in a direct way. Each step is more pressing than the previous one** . (_Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 15: Study on Matthew_, Chapter 8)

We all must learn to take care of others and to pray, "Lord, show me the way." First you need to ask. If the way does not open up, then you must seek. **If the way still does not open up, then you must knock. To knock means to come close to the One whom you are seeking. When you ask, there may still be a distance, but when you knock, there is no distance. Rather, you are directly in front of the One you are seeking. Thus, you need to spend time to seek the Lord** .

The matter of knocking and having the door opened is good for 7:14. **The narrow gate will open to the kingdom people by their knocking** . (_Life-Study of Matthew_, Chapter 23)

Our talking is also related to another very important matterâ€”the matter of prayer. **In Matthew 7:7-8 the Lord said that if we ask, we will receive; that if we seek, we will find; that if we knock, it shall be opened to us** . Asking, seeking, and knocking are linked with our judging. The Lord was indicating that a judging person cannot have a proper prayer life. The more we judge or talk or gossip, the less we will be able to pray. This is certain. On the contrary, the less we gossip and talk, the more we will pray. If on the one hand we would practice not talking, gossiping, or judging, and on the other hand exercise the proper discernment in sharing the truths of God and the experiences of Christ with others, then we will be able to pray. **First we ask; then we seek and knock** . Sometimes asking is sufficient. At other times we need to seek and to knock. **We may say that we ask for the Lord's grace, seek after the Lord's Person, and knock for the Lord's presence** . It is easy to have the Lord's grace, but it is difficult to have the Lord's Person, and even more difficult to have the Lord's presence.

A proper prayer life is linked to "judge not." If we do not talk in a loose way and if we do not speak about God's truths and our experiences of Christ in a careless way, we will have a proper prayer life. We will have the ground to ask, seek, and knock. (_The Kingdom_, Chapter 34)

We know that God does not do anything that is contrary to His will. If it is His will to open the door, why does He have to wait until we knock before He will open? Why would He not open the door for us according to His will, without us knocking? He knows everything. If He knows that we need an open door, why will He wait until we knock before He opens? If the door should be open, if it is God's will that there is the open door, and if God knows that we need to have the door open, why does He not just open the door? Why do we have to knock? What convenience does it give to God for us to knock on the door?

We also have to ask: Since God's will is to open the door, and since it is His will to have the door open, will God not open the door if we do not knock? Will He allow His will and His justice to be delayed and not accomplished just for the sake of waiting for our prayer? Will He allow His will of opening the door to be limited by our not knocking on the door?

If this is so, then God's will is restricted by us! Is God really omnipotent? If He is, why can He not open the door independent of us? Why must He wait for us to knock before He will open the door? Will God really accomplish His will? If He will, why does the opening of the door (His will) have to be controlled by our knocking on the door (prayer)?

After we have asked these questions, we will see that prayer is indeed a great mystery. Here we can see a principle of God's work. This principle is that God's people have to pray before God will rise up to work. God's will is accomplished by the prayer of those who belong to Him. The believers' prayers accomplish God's will. God will not accomplish His will alone; He will only accomplish His will when His people are sympathetic with Him in prayer.

If this is the case, prayer is nothing but the believers' act of working together with God. Prayer is the union of the believers' will with God's will. The prayer of the believers on earth is an utterance of God's will in heaven. Prayer is not an utterance of our own wishes, a plea for God to yield to our cry and fulfill our own wishes. Prayer is not to compel God to change His will by force or ask Him to do what He does not want to do. Prayer is the believers' utterance of God's will out of their own mouth; it is the believers' request before God that He accomplish His own will.

Prayer does not change what God has ordained. Prayer never changes anything. **Prayer only accomplishes what God has ordained. On the contrary, the lack of prayer and the absence of prayer changes things. When God's people do not work together with God, He will allow many of the things ordained by Him to be delayed and not be fulfilled.** (_Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 08: The Present Testimony (1_), Chapter 3)
