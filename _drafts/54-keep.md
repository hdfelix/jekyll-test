guard, hold fast, store up

**Scriptures** :

Psa. 119:11 **In my heart I have treasured up Your word** / That I might not sin against You.

Luke 2:19 But **Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart** .

Luke 8:15 But that which is in the good earth, these are those who in a noble and good heart **hear the word and hold it fast and bear fruit with endurance** .

Luke 11:28 But He said, **Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it** .

John 14:23 Jesus answered and said to him, **If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word** , and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.

Col. 3:16 **Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly** in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.

2 Tim. 1:14 **Guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.**

**Footnotes** :

1 Tim. 2:152Faith is for receiving the Lord (John 1:12), love is for enjoying Him (John 14:21, 23), and holiness is for expressing Him through sanctification. By faith we receive the Lord and thereby please God (Heb. 11:6); **by love we enjoy the Lord and thereby keep His word (John 14:23);** and by holiness we express the Lord and thereby see Him (Heb. 12:14).

2 Tim. 1:141 This is the deposit the Lord entrusted to us, in contrast to the deposit we entrusted to Him, mentioned in v. 12. According to v. 13, **the deposit here must refer to the deposit of healthy words, including the riches of life in His word, which the Lord has stored in us.** See note 201 in 1 Tim. 6.

2 Tim. 1:142 Lit., is indwelling. The Holy Spirit dwells in our spirit (Rom. 8:16). **Hence, for us to guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit requires that we exercise our spirit.**

**Ministry Excerpts** :

"In my heart I have treasured up Your word" (Psa. 119:11, see also v. 98). **We should treasure up the word of the Bible in our hearts so that we can apply it at any time or place** . **Our hearts should store up the word of the Bible to prepare us for unexpected needs. We should diligently store up the word of the Bible in our hearts instead of looking for an applicable word in the Bible only when we encounter problems or difficulties.** Going to the Bible at such times is only a second-rate solution. The best solution is to treasure up the word of the Bible in our hearts so that when we encounter a specific need, we will be able to apply the word immediately. **The Bible should be not only in our hands but in our hearts. When we have the word of the Bible in our hearts, we can apply it to any situation, even if we do not have the Bible in our hands. This is proper.**

"Dwell in you richly in all wisdom" (Col. 3:16). **We should not only treasure up the word of the Bible in our hearts but also let it dwell in us richly. To do this, we need all wisdom and all ways to store the word of the Bible in our hearts richly. Our hearts should be rich storehouses of the Bible.** Regrettably, many believers are too poor in this matter. Their hearts are storehouses of worldly knowledge and many things, but they have not stored up the word of God. Therefore, they are spiritually poor and have difficulty knowing the will of God when they encounter problems. In order for them to have a turn in spiritual matters, they must learn to let the word of the Bible dwell in them richly.

"Keep" (Psa. 119:9; Luke 11:28; see also James 1:25). **We must keep the word of the Bible in order to obtain blessing and benefit. The blessing that we obtain from keeping the word of the Bible is truly great!** It is even greater than the blessing that Mary obtained in bearing the Lord Jesus. **Therefore, we should respond to the word in the Bible by keeping it.** (_Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures, Vol. 3_, pp. 482-484)

Colossians 3:16 says, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God." The word dwell means "make home." In this verse the words teaching, admonishing, and singing modify the verb dwell, indicating that **the way to allow the word of Christ to dwell in us is by teaching, admonishing, and singing. The more we teach, admonish, and sing, the more the word of Christ will make home in us.**

Ephesians 5:18-19 says, "Be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord." **This verse shows that our speaking and our singing should be not from our mind but from our heart and our spirit. Letting the word of Christ make home in us is a matter not of remembering with our mind but of exercising our spirit.**

Colossians 3:16 and Ephesians 5:18-19 show that our reading of the Bible should become our singing. **The highest way to enjoy reading the Bible is to sing the words with a spontaneous melody. This is a sweet experience. Instead of merely memorizing the words of the Bible, we should sing them.**

**Eating the word in the morning by pray-reading and sing-reading verses will result in a healthy spiritual metabolism for the whole day,** killing the negative things in our being and nourishing our inner man to grow and be empowered. The proper way to live the Christian life is to contact the word in the Bible, which embodies God, Christ, the Spirit, and the divine life. We can read, pray, and sing the word to receive the elements of Christ, His killing death, and His nourishing resurrection. As a result, we will walk with the Lord and in the Lord, always experiencing the killing and the nourishing, the operating of death and life (2 Cor. 4:12). This is the Christian life. (_The Healthy Word_, p. 79)

**From the time we were saved we have received many things from God as a deposit, like a deposit in**** a bank. Within us, and especially within our spirit, we have a divine deposit. God's life, God's Spirit, and all the precious truths we have seen in the Lord's recovery have been deposited into our being. ****How can we guard this deposit? We can guard this deposit only through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us. If we act, behave, and have our life in the Spirit, all that has been deposited into us will be guarded.** But if we neglect the Spirit and walk in the flesh and according to our mind, we shall be the same as the nations, who are apart from God (Eph. 4:17-18). If this is our situation, there will not be any guarding of the good things that have been deposited into our being. **We need to guard the good deposit by the Spirit, who is working within us to keep us in the divine fellowship. As we are preserved in fellowship with the Triune God, we shall have an intensified care for all the truths that have been deposited into our being. Because the Holy Spirit dwells in our spirit, guarding the good deposit through the Holy Spirit requires that we exercise our spirit** (_Conclusion of the New Testament, The (Msgs. 079-098),_ Chapter 14).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 812** _

1I come to Thee, dear Lord,

My heart doth thirst for Thee;

Of Thee I'd eat, of Thee I'd drink.

Enjoy Thee thoroughly.

2Just to behold Thy face,

For this my heart doth cry;

I deeply long to drink of Thee

My thirst to satisfy.

3Thy glorious, radiant face

My heart delights to see;

Here I'd abide and ne'er depart,

Beholding constantly.

4In such a fellowship

Thou, Lord, art grace to me;

My heart and spirit gladdened, filled,

I enter rest in Thee.

5Lord, I would linger here,

Still seeking after Thee,

Continue in the Word and prayer

Till Thou dost flow thru me.

_ **Hymn 811, ss. 5-8** _

5Thou in the Word art the Spirit and life,

Thus by the Word I may feed upon Thee;

Thou dost as Spirit in my spirit live,

Thus I may drink in the spirit of Thee.

6Now to enjoy Thee I come to Thy Word,

On Thee to feed till my hunger is o'er.

Now in my spirit I turn unto Thee,

Of Thee to drink till I'm thirsty no more.

7Feeding and drinking, Lord Jesus, of Thee,

Feeding by reading, and drinking by prayer;

Reading and praying, I eat and I drink,

Praying and reading-Lord, Thou art my fare.

8Here, O my Lord, may I feast upon Thee;

Flood with Thy Spirit and fill by Thy Word;

May, Lord, Thou be such a feast unto me

As man hath never enjoyed nor e'er heard.

_ **Hymn 801, ss. 4-6** _

4Life-giving Spirit Thou, as well as Word,

Now e'en the Spirit in the Word Thou art;

When thru the Spirit giv'n, I touch the Word,

Fulness divine to me Thou dost impart.

5In Thee I may with God have fellowship,

And thru the Scripture I on Thee may feed;

Thru study of the Word with prayer to God

Thy glorious riches fully meet my need.

6Teach me to exercise my spirit, Lord,

Thy Word to study, so to contact Thee,

That Thou, the living Word, with Scripture, too,

As one my daily manna e'er may be.
