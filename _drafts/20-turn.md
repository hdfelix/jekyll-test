Return

**Scriptures** :

Psa. 51:13 I will teach transgressors Your ways, / And **sinners will turn back to You** .

Isa. 45:22 **Turn to Me and be saved** , / All the ends of the earth, / For I am God and there is no one else.

Jer. 24:7 And I will give them a heart to know Me, that I am Jehovah; and they will be My people, and I will be their God **; for they will return to Me with their whole heart.**

Joel 2:12 Yet even now, / Declares Jehovah, / **Turn to Me with all your heart** / And with fasting and weeping and mourning; 13 And rend your hearts, / And not your garments, / **And turn to Jehovah your God,** / For He is gracious and compassionate, / Long-suffering and abundant in lovingkindness / And repentant of evil.

Zech. 1:3 Therefore say to them, Thus says Jehovah of hosts, **Return to Me, declares Jehovah of hosts, and I will return to you, says Jehovah of hosts** .

Matt. 3:2 And saying, **Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near** . 3 For this is he who was spoken of through Isaiah the prophet, saying, "A voice of one crying in the wilderness, **Prepare the way of the Lord** ; make straight His paths."

Acts 26:18 To open their eyes, **to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God** , that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me. 20 But declared both to those in Damascus first and in Jerusalem and throughout all the country of Judea and to the Gentiles **that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance** .

2 Cor. 3:16 But **whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away** .

1 Thes. 1:9 For they themselves report concerning us what kind of entrance we had toward you and **how you turned to God from the idols to serve a living and true God.**

**Footnotes** :

Mat 3:2, note 1 **To repent** is to have a change of mind issuing in regret, **to have a turn in purpose** .

Mat 3:3, note 2 The way, similar to a street, and the paths, similar to lanes, are a portrait of man's heart with all its parts. **To repent unto the Lord with our whole being and with our whole heart and to let the Lord come in is to prepare the way of the Lord** . To allow the Lord to further occupy every part of our heart, including the mind, the emotion, and the will, is to make straight the paths of the Lord. Hence, **to prepare the way of the Lord and make His paths straight is to change our mind, to turn our mind toward the Lord and make our heart right, that through repentance every part and avenue of our heart may be straightened by the Lord for the kingdom of the heavens** (Luke 1:16-17).

2 Cor 3:16, note 1 This indicates that when their heart is away from the Lord, the veil lies on their heart. **When their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. Actually, their turned-away heart is the veil. To turn their heart to the Lord is to take away the veil** .

2 Cor 3:17, note 1 Or, furthermore, in addition. **When the heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away** . In addition to this, furthermore, the Lord is the Spirit, who would give us freedom. **Since the Lord is the Spirit, when the heart turns to Him, the veil is taken away and the heart is freed from the bondage of the letter of the law** .

**Ministry Excerpts** :

When we were fallen, our heart was turned away from the Lord, but **when we repented, our heart turned to the Lord.**** The turning of the heart to the Lord is not once and for all. The heart must be turned to the Lord all the time, day by day. Every morning we must turn our heart again toward the Lord. After rising, we should go to the Lord and tell Him, "Lord, here I am. By Your mercy and grace I wish to turn my heart anew to You for this day **."** When our heart is turned to the Lord, the veil is gone **. Many people wonder why they do not have the Lord's guidance and why they do not know the Lord's will. But the problem is, where is their heart and in what direction is their heart turned? Their heart must be turned and tuned to the Lord.** When I was young, I prayed over 2 Corinthians 3:16 nearly every day: "Lord, cause me to turn my heart to You." I must testify that this kind of prayer works. I encourage you to try it **.** Before you read the Word in the morning, you should first turn your heart to the Lord**. If you do this, the veil will be gone, and there will be light. The veil between you and the Lord will be taken away by your turning your heart to Him, and you will see the light (_The Economy of God,_ Chapter 7).

Man's heart always turns to the world, but **only when man turns to God will God shine on him with His light** . Suppose there is a light behind me. If I do not turn around, I will not receive its shining because light shines in a particular direction. When a man's heart is turned to things other than God, it is impossible for God to shine on him. Some pray that God would shine on them, but still they do not receive any light. Some may even wonder why others always receive light, but they never receive any light. This is solely because they are turned away from God. **Whenever they turn around, God's light will have a way to shine on them. "Whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away" (2 Cor. 3:16).** If a Christian does not have light within him, this shows that inwardly he is still somewhat turned away from God. **Since he is turned away from God, he needs to turn around. What is consecration?**** Consecration is to turn our whole being around **. When our heart is in the world, we spontaneously are facing the world;** hence, we need to turn. Whenever our heart is facing the Lord within, immediately our inner being will be enlightened, and we will know what is the will of God and what is not the will of God**.

**Through my experiences, I have learned one vital lesson: to turn to the spirit. We all must learn not to take care of so many outward things, but we must learn to turn to the spirit all the time** . We need to forget about our environment. Whenever we are in spirit, we often have the sense that we are not on earth. Everything is so fresh and new in our spirit… We Christians think, consider, and worry too much. Many times we will not turn to the spirit until we are forced to. If our business runs well, we do not turn to the Lord. Therefore, we often need troubles, trials, and painful sufferings, things we cannot get through, to force us to give up and turn back to the Lord. **We must learn to be willing to turn to our spirit. Even if we could get through in some area outside of the spirit, we should still come back to the spirit.**** When we turn to our spirit, we sense the fresh air within us; we are refreshed, strengthened, and uplifted** (Christ our Portion, Chapter 3).

**If a person cannot turn to his spirit or be calm, he can start by reading the Word. He can then use the words of the Bible to calm his thoughts in order to turn to his spirit. He can turn any words that touch him into prayer** . **This is an easy way to turn to our spirit.** Some saints are able to turn directly to their spirit without any help. Whenever they want to pray, they only need to close their eyes, and they can stop their entire being…They are not bothered by distractions…Such a person is very experienced in his spirit; his spirit is very strong. He is able to control himself and is not bothered by anything. When he wants to pray, he can turn his entire being to his spirit (_How to Enjoy God and Practice the Enjoyment of God_, Chapter 19).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 1345** _

Whenever the heart shall turn to the Lord,

The veil shall be taken away.

So turn your heart to the Lord all the day,

And the veil shall be taken away.

Now the Lord is that Spirit,

And where the Spirit of the Lord is,

There is liberty—such liberty!

Whenever the heart shall turn to the Lord,

The veil shall be taken away.

_ **Hymn 645, s. 1 & Chorus** _

O soul, are you weary and troubled?

No light in the darkness you see?

There's light for a look at the Savior,

And life more abundant and free.

Turn your eyes upon Jesus,

Look full in His wonderful face,

And the things of earth will grow strangely dim,

In the light of His glory and grace.

_ **Hymn 1141 ss. 3, 4** _

3Now we're learning to turn to our spirit,

Now we're learning to take Christ as life;

Now we're learning to feed upon Jesus

And be freed from all struggling and strife.

4Hallelujah for life in the Spirit,

Hallelujah for newness within.

When we turn from our mind to our spirit,

We enjoy all the riches of Him.

_ **Hymn 770, s. 3** _

To the spirit turn, and the incense burn,

Touch the living fountain of life;

To the spirit turn, and the incense burn,

Touch the living fountain of life.

Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

Touch the living fountain of life;

Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

Touch the living fountain of life.
