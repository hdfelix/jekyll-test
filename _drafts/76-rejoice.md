delight, exult, joy

**Scriptures** :

Psa. 85:6 Will You not again **revive us, / That Your people may rejoice in You** ?

Psa. 90:14 **Satisfy us in the morning with Your lovingkindness / That we may give a ringing shout and rejoice all our days.**

Psa. 105:3 Glory in His holy name; / **Let the heart of those who seek Jehovah rejoice** .

Psa. 119:162 **I rejoice at Your word, / Like one who finds great spoil.**

Hab. 3:18 Yet I will exult in Jehovah; / **I will rejoice in the God of my salvation** .

1 Thes. 5:16 **Always rejoice**

Phil. 3:1 **Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord.** To write the same things to you, for me it is not irksome, but **for you it is safe.**

Phil. 4:4 **Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice.**

1 Pet. 4:13 But inasmuch as you share in the sufferings of Christ, **rejoice, so that also at the revelation of His glory you may rejoice exultingly** .

**Footnotes:**

Lev. 25:103 Perhaps related to the word ram; meaning a time of shouting, or a time of the trumpeting of the ram's horn. The trumpeting of the ram's horn signifies **the preaching of the gospel as the proclaiming of liberty in the New Testament jubilee to all the sinners sold under sin (Luke 4:18-19; Acts 26:17b-18) that they may return to God and God's family and may rejoice with shouting in the enjoyment of God's salvation** .

Phil. 1:181 The apostle's heart was so broadened by grace that he even rejoiced in his opposers' preaching of Christ in pretense. What an upright spirit this is! **This was the outworking of the life, nature, and mind of Christ, who lived in the apostle. His experience of Christ was an enjoyment. Such a life rejoices no matter what the circumstances may be** .

Phil. 3:12  **To rejoice in the Lord is a safeguard, a security** .

Phil. 4:41 **Rejoicing affords us the strength for the oneness** spoken of in vv. 2 and 3. Furthermore, **rejoicing in the Lord is the secret of having the excellent virtues** listed in vv. 5-9.

**Ministry Excerpts** :

Philippians 4:4 says, "Rejoice in the Lord always." In describing joy, the Bible uses either the word great, full, or always. Always means "all the time." Paul was saying, "Have you heard this word? If you have not heard it yet, let me repeat it for you: 'Again I will say, rejoice.'" **If we did not get it yet, he would repeat it once moreâ€”that we should rejoice. The life that God gives is a life of joy. Rejoicing is the daily life of a Christian.** There may be tribulations and trials, but there is still rejoicing. The opposite of rejoicing is being anxious. Many people are anxious for their children, their money, or their business. But the Word of the Lord says, "In nothing be anxious" (Phil. 4:6). We think that anxiety is justified, but the Lord says, "In nothing be anxious." This is because we should always rejoice (The Overcoming Life, Chapter 10).

**Philippians 4:4 says, "Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice." The first thing we have to know is that rejoicing is a commandment of God** . God never commands us to do what we cannot do. Every command of God to man can be done by man. The Bible commands us not to be happy, but to rejoice in the Lord. **We should not only rejoice in the Lord, but rejoice in Him always. If a man worships idols, we know that this violates God's commandment. But we may not realize that if a Christian is not rejoicing, he is also breaking God's commandment** . We may think that if we worship idols we are breaking the commandments but if we do not rejoice, we are not breaking the commandments. Actually, in both cases we are breaking His commandments. **Since rejoicing is a command of God, we must practice accordingly** ; otherwise, we are breaking God's commandment. Perhaps you may think, "I have such and such a problem. How can I rejoice? I am a laborer and have to support a family. Even though I toil and sweat, I do not earn much in wages, and living expenses are so high. How can I rejoice?" As a result, you may become anxious. Perhaps you are a mother and a widow. You have many children and a meager income which does not adequately cover your expenses. Since you live from hand to mouth, you may think, "How can a person like me rejoice?" Perhaps you are a student, doctor, master, or servant, and you feel that it is difficult to deal with other people in the world. You cannot rejoice. **Indeed, many things can make you unable to rejoice. But please note that the rejoicing in verse 4 is not to rejoice in yourself, but to "rejoice in the Lord always** ."

A widow who has just lost her husband, whose possessions are about to be pawned, and whose landlord is about to drive her out of the house is suffering greatly under these circumstances. Yet she can still play with her little baby. She cannot rejoice in the house, her deceased husband, or her surroundings. But she can rejoice. She can rejoice in her baby. **In the same way, God has not asked us to rejoice in our environment, in things going our way, or in any kind of happiness. God tells us to "rejoice in the Lord." The world may oppose us, misunderstand us, reject us, and trap us, but no one can cover the heavens from us. The Lord never changes** . The world could put Paul into prison and lock him up, but it could not keep the Lord within Paul away from him. Therefore, Paul and Silas were able to sing and praise God within the prison cell. **We should be clear about one thing: do not rejoice in the environment; rather, rejoice in our Lord. When friends and relatives are away and the heart is aching and weeping, we can be comforted and rejoice if we look to the Lord who loves us and whom we love. He is enough to satisfy our heart** . But Christians are very forgetful! We may hear about this today but forget about it tomorrow! This is why Paul followed by saying, "Again I will say, rejoice." **God's intention is that we rejoice. Therefore, whatever happens, we must rejoice** (_Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 18: Notes on Scriptural Messages (2),_ Chapter 4).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 717** _

1. O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,Though all things around us be trying,Though floods of affliction like sea billows roar,It's better to sing than be sighing.

Then rejoice evermore, rejoice evermore,  
It is better to sing than be sighing:  
It is better to live than be dying;  
So let us rejoice evermore.

1. O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,When the darts of the tempter are flying,For Satan still dreads, as he oft did of yore,Our singing much more than our sighing.

O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,  
When sickness upon us is stealing,  
No cordial like gladness our strength can restore,  
For joy is the fountain of healing.

_ **Hymn 146** _

1. Rejoice, the Lord is King,Your Lord and King adore;Mortals, give thanks and singAnd triumph evermore:

Lift up your heart, lift up your voice;  
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice.

1. His kingdom cannot fail;He rules o'er earth and heav'n;The keys of death and hellAre to our Jesus giv'n:
2. Jesus, the Savior reigns,The God of truth and love:When He had purged our stainsHe took His seat above:

1. He sits at God's right handTill all His foes submit,And bow to His command,And fall beneath His feet:

_ **Hymn 285** _

1. Come and rejoice with me!For once my heart was poor,And I have found a treasuryOf love, a boundless store.
2. Come and rejoice with me!I, once so sick at heart,Have met with One who knows my case,And knows the healing art.
3. Come and rejoice with me!For I was wearied sore,And I have found a mighty armWhich holds me evermore.
4. Come and rejoice with me!My feet so wide did roam,And One has brought me from afar,To find in Him my home.
5. Come and rejoice with me!For I have found a FriendWho knows my heart's most secret depths,Yet loves me without end.
6. I knew not of His love;And He had loved so long,With love so faithful and so deep,So tender and so strong.
7. And now I know it all,Have heard and known His voice,And hear it still from day to day.Can I enough rejoice?

76 - Rejoice
