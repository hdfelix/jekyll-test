**Scriptures** :

John 14:1 Do not let your heart be troubled; **believe into God** , **believe also into Me** .

Rom. 10:11 For the Scripture says, " **Everyone who believes on Him shall not be put to shame** ."

2 Cor. 4:13 And having the same spirit of faith according to that which is written, "I believed, therefore I spoke," **we also believe, therefore we also speak** .

Gal. 3:9 So then **they who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham** .

Eph. 1:19 And what is **the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe** , according to the operation of the might of His strength,

Heb. 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to Him, for **he who comes forward to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him** .

1 Pet. 2:7 **To you therefore who believe is the preciousness** ; but to the unbelieving, "The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the head of the corner,"

**Footnotes** :

Matt 8:26, note 1 **Faith comes from and depends on the word of the Lord** (Rom. 10:17). In v. 18 the Lord gave them a word, telling them to depart to the other side. If they had believed that word, they would not have needed to pray as they did in v. 25. They did not have a full realization concerning the Lord's word; thus, their faith was little.

Mark 1:15, note 3 Repentance is mainly in the mind; believing is mainly in the heart (Rom. 10:9). **To believe in is to believe into the things in which we believe and to receive into us the things in which we believe** . To believe in the gospel is mainly to believe in the Slave-Savior (Acts 16:31), and **to believe in Him is to believe into Him** (John 3:15-16) and to receive Him into us (John 1:12) that we may be organically united with Him. **Such a faith in Christ (Gal. 3:22) is given to us by God through our hearing of the word of the truth of the gospel** (Rom. 10:17; Eph. 1:13). **This faith brings us into all the blessings of the gospel** (Gal. 3:14). Hence, it is precious to us (2 Pet. 1:1). Such a precious faith must be preceded by repentance. See note 161 in ch. 16.

Rom 3:22, note 1 Or, faith in Jesus Christ. This faith refers to the faith of Jesus Christ in us, which has become the faith by which we believe in Him, as in v. 26; Gal. 2:16, 20; 3:22; Eph. 3:12; and Phil. 3:9.

**Faith has an object, and it issues from its object. This object is Jesus, who is God incarnate.**** When man hears Him, knows Him, appreciates Him, and treasures Him, He causes faith to be generated in man, enabling man to believe in Him**. Thus, He becomes the faith in man by which man believes in Him. Hence, this faith becomes the faith in Him, and it is also the faith that belongs to Him.

**In God's New Testament economy, God desires that man believe in Jesus, who is God incarnate** . If man does not believe in Him, he commits the unique sin before God (John 16:9). However, **if man believes in Him, he is righteous to the uttermost before God, and God reckons this faith as his righteousness. At the same time, this faith brings its object, that is, this One who is God incarnate, into those who believe in Him** . He is God's righteousness, and God has given Him as righteousness to those who are indwelt by Him (Jer. 23:6). All this is out of, and depends on, the faith that is in Him and of Him (Heb. 12:2).

Gal 2:16, note 1 Lit., faith of Jesus Christ. See note 221 in Rom. 3. Faith in Jesus Christ denotes an organic union with Him through believing. This is related to the believers' appreciation of the person of the Son of God as the most precious One. The believers are infused with the preciousness of Christ through the gospel preached to them. **This Christ becomes in them the faith by which they believe and the capacity to believe through their appreciation of Him. This faith creates an organic union in which they and Christ are one** .

2 Cor. 4:13, note 2 "Not distinctly the Holy Spirit,—but still not merely a human disposition: the indwelling Holy Spirit penetrates and characterizes the whole renewed man" (Alford). "Spirit of faith: not distinctly the Holy Spirit, nor, on the other hand, a human faculty or disposition, but blending both" (Vincent). The spirit of faith is the Holy Spirit mingled with our human spirit. **We must exercise such a spirit to believe and to speak, like the psalmist, the things we have experienced of the Lord, especially His death and resurrection. Faith is in our spirit, which is mingled with the Holy Spirit** , not in our mind. Doubts are in our mind. Here spirit indicates that it is by the mingled spirit that the apostles lived a crucified life in resurrection for the carrying out of their ministry.

**Ministry Excerpts** :

**Believing in God means to believe into God and to make ourselves one with God. In this kind of believing, a man admits that he is nothing, that he has nothing, and that he can do nothing. He agrees that he must be terminated** . **Thus, believing in God means to terminate ourselves and to let God be our very being, to let God be all that we should be. From the time we first believe in Him, we should not be anything** . We should be completely terminated and allow God to be everything in us (_Life-Study of Romans_, Chapter 7).

Many people have the mistaken impression that believing in the Lord Jesus is simply saying, "Lord Jesus, I believe in You. I take You as my Savior." This is right, but the implications are far-reaching. It means that we must terminate ourselves, admitting that we are nothing, have nothing, and can do nothing. Every step and every moment we must trust in Him. I do not know how to do things; I only know how to trust in my Lord. **I have been called out of everything that is not God and now I believe into everything that is God. I believe in Him and I believe in all that He has accomplished for me. I believe in what He can do for me and in what He shall do for me. I put my full trust in Him** . This is the testimony of the called and believing race. As children of Abraham, the believing father, we are a believing people (Gal. 3:7-9). (_Life-Study of Romans,_ Chapter 6).

**Nothing is impossible to faith (see** _ **Hymns,** _ **#535), because faith is actually God Himself** . **The more of God you have, the more faith you have.** We can gain God by coming to the Bible, the written word… Before reading the Bible, it is good to call on the Lord at least two or three times, "O Lord Jesus. O Lord Jesus." Right away, the written word of the Bible becomes the living word. That is Christ. Then we react to Him, and He becomes the word as the Spirit, the word applied by the Spirit. Then we have God. **God is added into our being, and this God is the source of faith** (_Crystallization-Study of the Epistle to the Romans,_ Chapter 8).

**Ephesians 1 speaks of the power that is toward us who believe. As those who believe in the Lord Jesus and in the Bible, we can all proclaim, "Hallelujah, I believe! I believe in the Lord Jesus and I believe in the Word of God."** We do not need to fast and pray in order to receive the divine power, for this power is toward us who believe. **By believing we are positioned and qualified to receive the power of God. Hallelujah, this power is toward us who believe!** The way to receive this power is not to fast and pray for several days; it is simply to use the switch… Satan is not afraid of our pitiful, begging prayers, but he is afraid of our speaking in faith. We need to say, "I believe, I speak, I have the power, I am strong." This is not superstition; it is our Christian faith. Ephesians 1:19 says that this transmission is "toward us who believe." The little word "to" indicates a transmission. The power toward us who believe is the Triune God, the Creator of the universe, who became incarnated, passed through crucifixion, entered into resurrection and ascension, and has come down to us. This power has been installed in us, just as electricity is installed in a building. **We need to believe that this power is now right within us.** Many of us, however, are too natural and too logical… Logic is always opposed to faith, and faith is opposed to logic… **Whether you had any feeling regarding it or not means nothing. What is important is that you believe whatever the Bible says** (_Life-Study of Ephesians, _Chapter 17).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 535, s. 1** _

All things are possible to him

That can in Jesus' name believe;

Lord, I no more Thy name blaspheme,

Thy truth I lovingly receive.

I can, I do believe in Thee;

All things are possible to me.

_ **Hymn 295, ss. 2, 3** _

2Lord, I believe Thy precious blood,

Which, at the mercy seat of God,

Forever doth for sinners plead,

For me, e'en for my soul, was shed.

3Lord, I believe were sinners more

Than sands upon the ocean shore,

Thou hast for all a ransom paid,

For all a full redemption made.

_ **O God of Glory, s. 4** _

I couldn't, Lord, believe,

But, Lord, You still appeared.

Your life in me conceived,

Dear Lord, I now believe.

You called not being as being

In me conceiving.

Your life transfusing,

I'm now reacting.

O God of glory,

You're now my story.

Dear One, I can't refuse!

By You, I've been transfused.
