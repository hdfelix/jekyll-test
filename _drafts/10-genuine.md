sincere, truthful

**Scriptures** :

Josh. 24:14 Now therefore fear Jehovah, and **serve Him in sincerity and faithfulness** ; and put away the gods whom your fathers served across the River and in Egypt, and serve Jehovah.

1 Sam. 12:24 **Only, fear Jehovah and serve Him in truth with all your heart** , for consider what great things He has done for you.

John 4:23 But an hour is coming, and it is now, when the **true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truthfulness** , for the Father also seeks such to worship Him. 24 God is Spirit, and **those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness** .

**Footnotes:**

John 4:24, note 5: ( **truthfulness** ): According to the context of this chapter and the entire revelation of John's Gospel, **truthfulness here denotes the divine reality becoming man's genuineness and sincerity** (which are the opposite of the hypocrisy of the immoral Samaritan worshipper—vv. 16-18) for the true worship of God. The divine reality is Christ (who is the reality—14:6) as the reality of all the offerings of the Old Testament for the worship of God (1:29; 3:14) and as the fountain of the **living water, the life-giving Spirit (vv. 7-15), partaken of and drunk by His believers to be the reality within them, which eventually becomes their genuineness and sincerity in which they worship God with the worship that He seeks** . See note 66 in 1 John 1; Rom. 3:7; and note 82 in Rom. 15.

**Ministry Excerpts** :

**Genuine prayer is the result of a desire that comes from the heart. It is something that flows out from our inner being.** Genuine prayer is not made up of flippant and nice words. **Only genuine words that flow out from the deepest part of the heart can be considered as genuine prayer** . The goal of our prayer should be an answer from God rather than pleasing the brothers and sisters. (_Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 48: Messages for Building Up New Believers (1),_ Chapter 14).

**First, prayer that contacts God consists of words spoken genuinely from the heart. We must pray according to our inward feeling** . We should not exercise our mind like a student taking an exam. Neither should we focus on the wording of prayer as if we are writing an essay. Such prayers are not very genuine; they are rather pretentious. **When we come before God to pray, we should not be pretentious. We should speak what we feel within.** When we are angry, we should voice our anger before God. When we are happy, we should voice our happiness before God. When we are sad, we should voice our sadness before God. When we are under pressure, we should speak of this pressure before God. **When we sense that we are sinful, we should confess it before God. We should speak what we feel within, speaking genuine words from our heart. This can be likened to a young child who always speaks what is in his heart to his parents. The words of our children are always genuine** .…This should be our practice; we should not make up anything but simply pray according to our inward feeling. We should not be afraid of not knowing how to pray. God never blames people for not knowing how to pray. There are many examples in the Bible that prove that even unlearned prayers can be accepted by God. We may pray such prayers, but He will understand. He knows what we mean; He always answers us according to what is right. **We do not need to worry, and we do not need elaborate prayers when we fellowship with God. We must speak genuinely from our heart** . (Lessons for New Believers, Lesson 23, pp. 325-326).

**In the genuine prayer that God desires, He enters into us, mingles with us, and prays through us.**** Every genuine prayer is a dual prayer; outwardly we are praying, but inwardly God is praying**. Outwardly we petition, but inwardly He is petitioning. Outwardly we are speaking, but inwardly the Holy Spirit is speaking. Only this kind of dual prayer is genuine (_How to Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God,_ Chapter 3, Section 1)

Since prayer is an expression of the union of God and man, no true prayer can be uttered without God's initiation. **If a prayer is not initiated by God, it is not genuine prayer** . All those who truly know the meaning of prayer know that prayer is not merely a matter of God being mingled with man but a matter of God initiating something within man. Hence, **when we pray, we must learn to be calm and not follow our thoughts. Instead, we should turn from our mind to our spirit and follow the sense within our spirit. In genuine prayer a person has a certain sense in his spirit even before he prays.** This sense in the spirit is initiated by God's Spirit within our spirit. When the Spirit of God mingles with our spirit, He initiates or suggests something in our spirit, which is not necessarily in the form of intelligible words. Many times it is merely a sense or a feeling in our spirit.

**Since the presence of God and our mingling with Him are absolutely related to the sense in our spirit, we should learn to allow our inner sense to be the initiating and motivating element within us when we pray** .

It is wonderful that we are often able to comprehend the feeling in our spirit when we pray. At times a feeling may lead us to confess our failures and shortcomings or to pray for the church. Another feeling may lead us to pray for a brother in difficulty or to pray for the message meeting on the Lord's Day. We may even have a feeling to praise Him, thank Him, or exult Him. Sometimes we may have a feeling not to pray for anything, or even to praise or thank Him, but simply to bow down before Him and worship Him. There is no need for words or sounds. We simply prostrate before God in silence and worship Him. The more we worship, the fresher our spirit becomes, and the more we are satisfied. As we worship, we feel that we are touching God in our spirit. This is a prayer of worship that is generated by the feeling of the Holy Spirit within us.

As soon as we understand the meaning of these feelings from God, we should follow them in prayer. We should never restrict ourselves to the topic that we decided on prior to our prayer. If we restrict ourselves in this way, we will be in our mind, and we will be the initiator and motivator of our prayer. **Our spirit is not the only requirement for proper and genuine prayer. Prayer must be a joint prayer in which God is mingled with our spirit** . In this prayer God and man mingle together, and God is the Initiator and Motivator. Spiritual prayer is never directed by our mind, memory, or thoughts. It is directed by the sense in our spirit, and this sense comes from God's initiation.

**Hence, in genuine prayer we pray together with God; we pray by accompanying Him. We pray according to the feeling that God gives us. This enables God to pray with us in our prayer. We are praying, and He is also praying. He and we pray together. He is within us; He is praying one with us** . This is indeed an amazing matter. (_How to Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God,_ Chapter 20, pp. 221-223)

_ **Hymn 793** _

1My soul, be silent, wait upon the Lord!

First let Him speak to thee, then speak to Him;

True prayer in thee the Lord initiates,

Thou but a channel art expressing Him.

2My soul, be silent, wait upon the Lord!

Learn to deny thy thought and all thy will.

Learn to let God anoint thee with Himself

And thru thy prayer His purposes fulfill.

3My soul, be silent, wait upon the Lord!

Silent to all thy wishes and thy plans,

Silent to all thy earthly cares and calls,

That God may work in thee all His demands.

4My soul, be silent, wait upon the Lord!

Yield to the spirit all thy heart and mind;

Here let the spirit show what God reveals,

Thee its obedient servant thus to find.

5My soul, be silent, wait upon the Lord!

Learn thus to let the Spirit pray thru thee;

All of thy being with the Spirit move,

Thy prayer will thus God's own expression be.

6My soul, be silent, wait upon the Lord!

Till in the spirit thou with God art one,

Till thru the spirit God possesses all

And thus transforms each part unto His Son.

7My soul, be silent, wait upon the Lord!

Till God may freely, fully flow thru thee,

Till all thy words and actions hour by hour

Are the fulfillment of God's will thru thee.
