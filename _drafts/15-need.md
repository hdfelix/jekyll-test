**Scripture Reading** :

Mark 2:17 And when Jesus heard this, He said to them, Those who are strong have no **need of a physician** , but those who are ill; I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners..

Luke 15:7 I tell you that in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner repenting than over ninety-nine righteous persons who have no **need of repentance** .

Eph. 4:29 Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but only that which is good for building up, **according to the need** , that it may give grace to those who hear.

Phil. 4:19 And my **God will fill your every need** according to His riches, in glory, in Christ Jesus.

Rev. 3:17 Because **you say, I am wealthy and have become rich and have need of nothing** , and do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked.

**Footnotes**** :**

Rev 3:17, note 1 The degraded recovered church boasts of her riches (which are mainly in the knowledge of doctrines). She does not realize that she is poor in life, blind in sight, and naked in conduct. Therefore **, she needs to buy gold to make herself rich, white garments to cover her nakedness, and eyesalve to cure her blindness,** as mentioned in the next verse.

**Ministry Excerpts**** :**

**Man has a spirit, so he has the need of the spirit. What the spirit needs is God. The spirit was created for man to contact God, so it needs God** . This is just like the stomach, which needs food because it was created for man to receive food. If there were no food, there would be no need to have a stomach; if there were no stomach, there would also be no need to have food. Likewise, if there were no God, there would be no need for the human spirit, and if there were no human spirit, man would also have no need for God. However, man has a spirit, and man's spirit came into existence for man to contact God; therefore, man needs God.

Man has various kinds of needs. Because man has three parts—body, soul, and spirit—he has three different kinds of needs. Man has a body, so he has the needs of the body. Man has a soul, so he has the needs of the soul. Likewise, man has a spirit, so he has the needs of the spirit. The needs of the body are physical, the needs of the soul are psychological, and the needs of the spirit are spiritual. Man has at least these three kinds of needs: physical needs, psychological needs, and spiritual needs. Only when these three kinds of needs are met can man feel no lack or emptiness. (_The Spirit and Service in the Spirit_, pp. 13-14)

**The spirit of man needs God, thirsts for God, and seeks after God. Man's need for God is a matter of the need in the spirit** ; it is not a matter of the intellect in the human mind. The need for God in the deepest part of man, which is his spirit, will not disappear just because his mind cannot understand it, nor will it diminish just by his reasoning in the mind. This is a matter of need, not a matter of reason. **Within man there is a spirit, which has a spiritual need. The need of the human spirit is for God** . (_The Spirit and Service in the Spirit_, p. 16)

God wants man to worship and serve Him, so He created man with a spirit. **The spirit in man causes man to sense the need for God and thus to thirst for God and pursue after God** . This is something that transcends human reason and is not up to man himself. We were created by God. God wants us to worship and serve Him; therefore, He prepared a faculty for us to worship and serve Him, which is the spirit within us. This spirit causes us to feel the need to worship and serve God. If we agree in our intellect to worship and serve God, our spirit causes us to sense this need. Even if we do not agree, our spirit still causes us to sense this need. This is similar to the way our stomach causes us to sense the need to eat. It does not matter if our intellect agrees or disagrees; the stomach causes us to feel such a need. This feeling is outside of and beyond our intellect.

Brothers and sisters, please remember that there is a spirit in man, that there is **a need in the spirit of man, and that this need is for God** . Not to mention the believers, even the unbelievers also need God in their spirit. They feel that they need something inside. Although they do not realize that this something is God, they feel that there is this need. **As saved ones, we have an even greater sense of this need. This morning if you did not draw near to God, pray to Him, open up yourself to Him to fellowship with Him, or breathe God in with your spirit, then surely you are unhappy and feel that there is a lack within you. But if you prayed to God, worshipped Him, and contacted Him this morning, you feel inwardly refreshed and satisfied. This is because there is a spirit in you, and the need of the spirit is for God.** (_The Spirit and Service in the Spirit_, pp. 17-18)

**If we learn to assimilate God in our spirit, we will experience Him as everything, and He will be whatever we need.** As we assimilate Him this way, we will discover that God is our comfort when we need comfort. He is our power when we need power. He is the word when we need a word. He is light when we need light. He is our patience when we need patience. He is love when we need love. He is holiness when we need holiness. He is our way when we need a way. He is wisdom when we need wisdom. All parents need forbearance toward their children. Once we receive God, He becomes forbearance to us. All children need to honor and obey their parents. Once we receive God into us, there is honor and obedience. **Our God is everything to us according to our need. When we assimilate Him, He is whatever we need. This is wonderful!** (_How to Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God_, p. 110)
