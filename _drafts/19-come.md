**Scriptures** :

Exo. 34:2 And be ready by the morning, and **come up in the morning**** to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to Me **, on the top of the mountain. 3 And** no one shall come up with you**, nor let anyone be seen anywhere on the mountain, nor let the flocks or herds graze in front of that mountain.

Psa. 95:2 **Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving** ; / Let us make a joyful noise to Him with psalms.

Isa. 55:1 **Ho! Everyone who thirsts, come to the waters,** / And you who have no money; / **Come, buy and eat;** / Yes, come, buy wine and milk / Without money and without price.

Matt. 11:28 **Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest** .

John 6:37 All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and **him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out** .

John 7:37 Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, **If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.**

Heb. 4:16 **Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace** that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help.

Heb. 7:25 Hence also He is **able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him** , since He lives always to intercede for them.

Heb. 10:22 **Let us come forward to the Holy of Holies**** with a true heart in full assurance of faith **,** having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience** and having our bodies washed with pure water.

Heb. 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to Him, for **he who comes forward to God must believe that He is** and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.

James 4:8a **Draw near to God** , and He will draw near to you.

**Footnotes** :

Exo 34:4, note 2 To meet with God in the morning is not only to meet with Him early in the day; it is also to meet with God in a situation that is full of light (cf. Prov. 4:18). **Like Moses, we should go to God alone, without any persons, matters, or things to distract or occupy us** (v. 3; cf. Mark 1:35).

Heb 4:16, note 2, par. 2 God's mercy and grace are always available to us. **However, we need to receive and find them by exercising our spirit to come to the throne of grace and contact our High Priest, who is touched with the feeling of all our weaknesses** . By this word the writer of this book encouraged the wearied Hebrew believers to receive mercy and find grace for timely help, that they might be set upright (12:12).

**Ministry Excerpts** :

God the Father not only is seen by the pure in heart but also draws near to those who draw near to Him. James 4:8 says, "Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you." God can be seen, but we need to be pure in heart. Likewise, **God desires to draw near to us, but we need to draw near to Him** . If we do not draw near to Him, He will not draw near to us in our experience. **His drawing near to us hinges on our taking the initiative first to draw near to Him** . Whenever we draw near to God under the redeeming blood of Christ, we sense that God is near to us. He draws near to us that we may experience and enjoy Him. God shows His love and sympathy toward us by drawing near to us. **When He draws near to us, He also comforts us, encourages us, and strengthens us** . God the Father is near to those who draw near to Him that He may give them His love, sympathize with them, and comfort, encourage, and strengthen them. (_Truth Lessons, Level 2, Vol. 3_, Chapter 1)

All real Christians have been to the altar—the cross of Christ. We thank God for this. But many Christians insist on staying at the altar, desiring to remain at the cross for eternity… Many people say, "Isn't the cross sufficient? Isn't the Lord's blood precious?" We appreciate the cross and the blood as much as, if not more than, all Christians do. But this is elementary; it is just the ABC's. **If we look at the portrait of the furniture in the tabernacle** , **we shall see that we must come forward. We must tell all Christians to come forward** . **Do not merely come forward to the laver, where you may have some washings of the Spirit. Come forward to the experience of the rich supply of nourishment at the showbread table and to the enlightenment of the lampstand. But there is still more than this. We must come forward to the incense altar which ushers us into the Holy of Holies. Our incense altar today is our prayer with Christ. Many times we begin praying in our mind, but our prayer ushers us into the spirit, into the Holy of Holies.** (_Life-Study of Hebrews,_ Chapter 40)

In the early days of my experience, nearly every time I knelt down to pray, I said, "Lord, thank You for being my Redeemer and for shedding Your blood for me." At that time I never realized I could come to the throne of grace and enjoy such a positive High Priest ministering the bread and wine. Every morning I confessed the failures of the day before, hoping I could do better that day. But that day also ended in failure and the next morning I would confess once again. This went on and on day after day. I only knew Christ as the High Priest typified by the order of Aaron. **Only after many years did I learn that I could come to the throne of grace and touch our High Priest who ministers to me the bread and wine. I do not need to try to be a success. I simply need to come forward to the throne of grace and enjoy the positive High Priest ministering the bread and wine** . This is the best breakfast. Whenever I enjoy such a breakfast, my whole day is a success. Just as we need a physical breakfast every day, so every morning we should enjoy Christ as our breakfast. The best breakfast table is the throne of grace where we enjoy Christ in such a positive way. Christ is our Melchisedec today. **How we need to come forward to the throne of grace to Him, the One who ministers the bread and wine** ! (_Life-Study of Hebrews,_ Chapter 28)

[In Matthew 15] when the Lord Jesus referred to the Canaanite woman as a dog, she said, "Yes, Lord; for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table" (v. 27). The Canaanite woman, not offended by the Lord's word, but rather admitting that she was a heathen dog, considered that at that time Christ, after being rejected by the children, the Jews, became crumbs under the table as a portion to the Gentiles. If I had been the Lord, I would have said, "Yes, as a dog, you have your portion. But don't you realize how dirty you are? If you would eat Me as the crumbs, you need to wash yourself." According to doctrine, this woman definitely needed to be washed. But why did the Lord Jesus not ask her to wash herself before eating of Him? Here the Lord is emphasizing the matter of eating. But this does not mean that we do not need to be washed. The blood is available. We may strike the blood and eat the Lamb… I believe that the Lord Jesus did this purposely to show His disciples that they needed only one thing—the eating. Even if we are as dirty as pagan dogs, we still have the right and the position to eat Jesus. Oh, we need to be uninhibited eaters! Do not wait until you have washed. **Come to the Lord just as you are and eat of Him. As the words of a hymn say, "Just as I am, I come." We need to say, "Lord, I come just as I am. I don't need to change or to be cleansed. Lord, I need You, and I come to You to eat. Even if I am a dirty dog, I come to You just as I am." Eating is primary, and eating is everything.** (_Life-Study of Matthew,_ Chapter 46)

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 1048** _

1Just as I am, without one plea,

But that Thy blood was shed for me,

And that Thou bid'st me come to Thee,

O Lamb of God, I come! I come!

2Just as I am, and waiting not

To rid my soul of one dark blot;

To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,

O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

3Just as I am, though tossed about

With many a conflict, many a doubt;

Fightings within, and fears without,

O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

4Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;

Sight, riches, healing of the mind;

Yes, all I need, in Thee to find,

O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

5 Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,

Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;

Because Thy promise I believe,

O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

6Just as I am, Thy love unknown

Has broken every barrier down;

Now, to be Thine, yea, Thine alone,

O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

_ **Hymn 554, s. 1** _

I come to His presence afresh

Ere the night has passed into morning;

And His face I see as it shines on me-

The Lord within is dawning.

And He speaks to me and reveals to me

All His riches for me today;

And with sweet delight I partake of Him,

My hunger has passed away.

_ **Hymn 769, s. 1** _

To the holiest place I'd come,

There within the veil to be;

There to touch the throne of grace,

Let life's water flow thru me.
