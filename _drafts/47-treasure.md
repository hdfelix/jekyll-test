**Scriptures** :

Psa. 119:11 **In my heart I have treasured up Your word** / That I might not sin against You. 14 I have rejoiced in the way of Your testimonies / As much as in all riches. 72 **The law of Your mouth is better to me / Than thousands of pieces of gold and silver** .

Job 23:12 As for the commandment of His lips, I have not turned back from it; / **I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my apportioned food** .

Matt. 26:6 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, 7 **A woman came to Him, having an alabaster flask of ointment of great value, and she poured it on His head as He reclined at table.** 8 But when the disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, Why this waste? 9 For this could have been sold for much and given to the poor. 10 But Jesus, knowing it, said to them, **Why do you trouble the woman? She has done a noble deed to Me** .

John 14:21 He who has My commandments and keeps them, he is the one who loves Me; and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him. 23 Jesus answered and said to him, **If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word,** and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.

**Footnotes** :

Matt. 26:81 The disciples considered Mary's love offering to the Lord a waste. **Throughout the past twenty centuries thousands of precious lives, heart treasures, high positions, and golden futures have been "wasted" upon the Lord Jesus. To those who love Him in such a way He is altogether lovely and worthy of their offering** . What they have poured upon Him is not a waste but a fragrant testimony of His sweetness.

Rom. 3:221, par.1 **Faith has an object, and it issues from its object. This object is Jesus, who is God incarnate. When man hears Him, knows Him, appreciates Him, and treasures Him, He causes faith to be generated in man, enabling man to believe in Him.** Thus, He becomes the faith in man by which man believes in Him. Hence, this faith becomes the faith in Him, and it is also the faith that belongs to Him.

**Ministry Excerpts** :

**As those who lovingly sought God, the psalmists treasured the law of God.** Psalm 119:14 says, "I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches." **The psalmists treasured God's testimony as their wealth** . Psalm 119:72 continues, "The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver." Then in 119:127 the psalmist goes on to say, "Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold." These verses reveal that the psalmists not only loved God, but also treasured His law, which was to them the word of God and the testimony of God. **They valued God's law more than silver and gold. They treasured the word of God** (_Life-Study of Exodus,_ Chapter 52).

**The psalmist also treasured the Word of God. He treasured it as great spoil (v. 162), as all riches (v. 14), above thousands of gold and silver (vv. 72, 127), and as a heritage forever (v. 111)** . Spoil refers to valuables taken away from an enemy. If we muse upon the Word, the enemy will be defeated, and we shall gather much spoil. Then we shall become rich and possess gold and silver, which will become our heritage. In ancient times, when a king conquered his enemies, he seized the gold and silver. **Likewise, when we enjoy the Word and defeat the enemy through the Word, we shall gain spoil from the conquered enemy. Then we shall have the riches, the gold and silver, and the heritage** .

Some may complain that what I have said about treasuring the Word of God is too experiential. If we do not understand the matter in this way, how should we treasure the Word as our spoil? We need to muse upon the Word and experience victory over the enemy through the Word. Then we shall have the spoil, the spoil will be our riches, the riches will be our gold and silver, and this will become our inheritance. **I can testify that, for the most part, my inheritance has come to me in this way. When the enemy is defeated through the Word, I gain gold and silver as my heritage** .

Verse 11 says, "Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee." Treasure should be hidden. However, many people like to display their wealth instead of concealing it. This way is not the biblical way. **According to the Bible, we should hide our treasure. We should treasure God's Word and hide it in our heart** (_Life-Study of Exodus,_ Chapter 57).

**If we have tasted the pray-reading, we will treasure every word of the Bible.** If I had the time, I could pray-read Genesis 1:1 for a whole day. The more we pray, the tastier it becomes. "O God, You have created the heavens. We cannot create the heavens. Today we can only enjoy the heavens. You have done too marvelous a work in creating the moon, the stars, and the sun in the heavens. Not only have You created the heavens; You have created the earth as well. All things on earth are created by You!" This kind of pray-reading will fully mingle the Lord's word with our spirit. It will give our spirit the greatest exercise (_The Organic Practice of the New Way,_ Chapter 4).

Luke 1:37 says, "No word will be impossible [or powerless] with God." God's word is sharp and powerful. We must let the word of God dwell richly in our hearts, and we must allow His word to gain ground in us. We must also be able to use it as our weapon to withstand the devil. When the Lord was tempted by the devil in the wilderness, He overcame with the words of Scripture. **God's word is indeed sharp and powerful. Therefore, we should treasure His word and put our trust in His word** (_Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 34: The Glorious Church,_ Chapter 10).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 169** _

1Thou, Lord, to God art precious,

His chosen, His delight;

With oil of joy, anointed,

How comely in His sight.

Chorus

We treasure with affection

Thy perfect comeliness,

Thy sweetness and Thy fragrance,

And all Thy loveliness.

2The altogether lovely,

The fairest of the fair,

Thy mouth with grace o'erfloweth;

Our hearts their love declare.

3The wise men offered treasures

And honored Thee at birth;

Thou wast by noble buried,

Still lovable in death.

4Thy head has been anointed,

The lovely One Thou art;

Thy feet anointed also,

Beloved in every part.

5Thy death as myrrh in sweetness

Man's spirit comforteth;

Thy resurrection fragrance

God's longing answereth.

6As henna flow'rs, Thy beauty

In loveliness complete;

As apple trees that flourish,

Thy fruit abundant, sweet.

7Sweet wine Thy love surpasseth,

Thy name an ointment is;

We take Thee as our love feast

And taste the sweetest bliss.

8As on Thyself we ponder

And all Thy beauty trace,

We taste to full Thy sweetness

And rest in Thine embrace.

_ **Mary poured out her love offering** _

1Mary poured out her love offering

To many such love was a waste.

Throughout all of the centuries

Such lovers Your sweetness do taste.

Precious lives and heart treasures, too

Positions and golden futures,

Have been "wasted" on You, Lord;

Your sweetness a fragrance so sure.

She took opportunity

To love You; Lord, with her best.

Like her, Lord, I too would pour

My love and all that I have.

2As I love You I set my beingâ€”

My spirit, my soul and body.

With my heart, my mind, and my strength,

Absolutely on Thee.

Lord, I let my entire being

Be occupied by Thee

As I enter in Your heart

I sense a fellowship sweet.

Occupied and lost in You;

My Lord, You're my everything.

Fellowship so intimate;

In spirit Lord I enjoy Thee.

3Lord there's none in heav'n nor on earth

That I desire but Thee.

Though my heart and flesh faileth, Lord,

Thou ever my portion will be.

All is vanity, all is dung;

I count all other things loss;

Everything else drains my love

But You have captured my heart.

Lord, I've seen Thy preciousness,

Thy worth, Thy reality.

Now, my Lord, I must confess

My heart is only for Thee.
