continual

**Scriptures** :

Psa. 16:8 **I have set Jehovah before me continually;** / Because He is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken.

Psa. 34:1 I will bless Jehovah at all times; / **His praise will continually be in my mouth.**

Phil. 1:19 For I know that for me this will **turn out to salvation** through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.

Phil. 2:12 So then, my beloved, even as you have **always obeyed** , not as in my presence only but now much rather in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;

1 Thes. 5:16 **Always**** rejoice, 17 Unceasingly pray, 18 In everything give thanks**; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.

**Footnotes** :

Phil. 2:12, note 4, par.2: In ch. 1 salvation comes through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, but here salvation comes from the operating God within us. The operating God is actually the Spirit of Jesus Christ. In both these cases salvation is **a practical, daily, moment-by-moment salvation** . The constant salvation in 1:19 is one in which a particular believer is saved from a specific encounter in a particular situation; whereas **the constant salvation in 2:12 is one in which any believer is saved from ordinary things in common situations in his daily living** .

1Thes. 5:17, note 1 (Unceasingly) This is to have **uninterrupted fellowship with God in our spirit** . **It requires perseverance** (Rom. 12:12; Col. 4:2) **with a strong spirit** (Eph. 6:18).

**Ministry Excerpts** :

We were reconciled to God through the death of Christ, and we are now being saved in His life. **This salvation is not our eternal salvation but our daily, moment by moment salvation** â€¦This means that if we are not in God experientially, we cannot be saved in the life of Christ. **We must have a direct, instant union with God.**** To be saved minute by minute, we must be in God, in the direct, ****constant**** , and instant union with God** (_The Experience and Growth in Life,_ Chapter 16).

**According to my consideration, breathing, drinking, eating, and growing are the "root hairs" of our Christian life to keep us in the continual dispensing** . The Triune God has passed through all the process to become the wonderful life-giving Spirit. Now we need to enjoy the continual dispensing of this One into our being. This is why we need the root hairs. A tree grows by its root hairs. Because we have been regenerated, we have the life and nature of the Triune God. **But in order to survive and to live, we need to breathe all the time. Every breath is a root hair** . We also need to drink and eat the Lord. The breathing, eating, drinking, and growing in the Lord are the root hairs (_Messages to the Trainees in Fall 1990,_ Chapter 5).

There are many aspects to the divine dispensing. Eating, drinking, and breathing are all a dispensing. The sealing of the Holy Spirit (Eph. 1:13) is also a dispensing. The anointing (1 John 2:20, 27) is one of the aspects of the divine dispensing. Every day we should be under the anointing. The good Samaritan's pouring of the oil and wine upon the wounded man in Luke 10 was a dispensing in type. Even the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19) is a bountiful dispensing. **We should constantly experience all of these aspects of the dispensing. All day long we should experience the anointing, sealing, moving, operating, satisfying, thirst quenching, and watering of the dispensing of the divine Trinity** . These are the growth of the root hairs. Many of us are short of the "root hair dispensing." We only take care of the big roots. However, the more root hairs a tree has, the stronger the tree is (_Messages to the Trainees in Fall 1990,_ Chapter 10).

When reading the Bible in this way, we also need to pay attention to **maintaining constant contact with the Lord** and not being distracted by the outward letters. We should not pay attention only to reading but forget to contact the Lord. It is not easy to maintain our fellowship with the Lord when reading the Bible for ten to twenty minutes in this way. Some people can contact the Lord without reading the Bible, but once they start reading the Bible, their contact with the Lord is interrupted. Thus, **to read the Word and still be able to**** maintain contact with the Lord is a spiritual skill that requires much practice**. We need to practice reading while contacting the Lord and contacting the Lord while reading so that our contact with the Lord is not interrupted by our reading. In our reading, we need to maintain and remain in fellowship with the Lord. If we read the Bible in this way for twenty minutes, we will have contact and fellowship with the Lord for twenty minutes. This will be a great benefit. (_Lessons for New Believers_, Lesson 24, pp. 341-342)

As we have seen, the leading of the Spirit is just the Spirit Himself who is so practical and so present. **So all the time before saying anything, before doing anything, before going to any place, even before thinking anything, we must firstly look at the indwelling Spirit. You may ask how you can have the turn to do this. The answer is simple: you have to build a habit.** Don't say anything before you look at the indwelling Spirit. Don't do anything before you look at the indwelling Spirit. Don't go to any place before you look at the indwelling Spirit. Even don't think anything before you look at the indwelling Spirit. Supposedly you have already passed through a crisis so that it is no more you that lives but He that lives. It is no more you to be your life, your nature, your everything. But the indwelling One now is your life, your nature, and your everything.

We all love the Lord, but I would like to tell you that the best love we can render to the Lord is not doing anything before looking at Him. I don't say looking unto Him. Unto Him may indicate that He is far away from you, in the heavens. I mean looking at Him, realizing He is not only with you, but in you. **You need such an intimate contact, even such an instant and constant contact with Him. You must learn to build up such a habit. If we all could live this way, what a revolution it would make in our daily life!** Please take this word in a simple way. (_Perfecting Training_, Chapter 50, pp. 539-540)

**Hymns**** :**

_ **Hymn 812** _

1I come to Thee, dear Lord,

My heart doth thirst for Thee;

Of Thee I'd eat, of Thee I'd drink.

Enjoy Thee thoroughly.

2Just to behold Thy face,

For this my heart doth cry;

I deeply long to drink of Thee

My thirst to satisfy.

3Thy glorious, radiant face

My heart delights to see;

Here I'd abide and ne'er depart,

Beholding constantly.

4In such a fellowship

Thou, Lord, art grace to me;

My heart and spirit gladdened, filled,

I enter rest in Thee.

5Lord, I would linger here,

Still seeking after Thee,

Continue in the Word and prayer

Till Thou dost flow thru me.

_ **Hymn 743, ss. 6, 7** _

6Ever true and pure and single

To the Lord our heart must be,

Poor in spirit, ever seeking

God to contact constantly.

7Keep our heart, Lord, in love's freshness,

And our spirit strengthen more,

That in newness of the spirit

We may touch Thee o'er and o'er.

_ **Just to be in You as You're in Me** _

1Just to be in You as You're in me.

Just abide in You, Lord, constantly.

Here I'm one with You, as You're with me.

Here we're joined as one, Lord, mutually.

God's dispensing, His economy,

In His Trinity,

He's transfusing, and He's mingling

All He is to me.

2I am just a branch, and You're the vine.

As I dwell in You, everything is fine.

Here I'd like to be, Lord, all the time.

Here I'm Yours, dear Lord, and You are mine.

3I'm a branch that's been, Lord, grafted in.

I'm supplied in You in this life union.

Here Your riches, Lord, in this sweet life flow.

As I dwell in You, I will surely grow.

4 As I dwell in You, and You in me,

Here I'm joined to You, Lord, practically.

As I stay with You, as You're with me,

We will mingle, Lord, subjectively.

5 As I'm loving You and enjoying You, Lord,

You become in me the rhema word.

Here I'll pray in You as You pray in me.

You'll bear fruit in me, Lord, abundantly.

6 As I dwell in You, Lord You're flowing through.

Lord, You're filling me, overflowing too.

Here we all are one and expressing You.

Here our joy is full as we dwell in You.
