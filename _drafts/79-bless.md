speak well of

**Scriptures** :

Psa. 34:1 **I will bless Jehovah at all times** ; / His praise will continually be in my mouth.

Psa. 100:4 Enter His gates with thanksgiving, / His courts with praise; / Give thanks to Him; **bless His name.**

Psa. 103:1 **Bless Jehovah, O my soul; / And all that is within me, bless His holy name** .

Psa. 145:1 I will extol You, O my God and King; / **And I will bless Your name forever and ever** .

Psa. 145:2 **Every day I will bless You** , / And I will praise Your name forever and ever.

2 Cor. 1:3 **Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassions and God of all comfort** .

Eph. 1:3 **Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ.**

1 Pet. 1:3 **Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us** unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,

**Footnotes** :

Psa. 34:12 **To bless God is to speak well of Him, praising Him with adoration** . See note 31 in Eph. 1.

Eph. 1:31 Lit., **well spoken of; i.e., praised with adoration. In this section the Triune God is well spoken of, praised with adoration:** the Father in His selection and predestination for God's eternal purpose (vv. 3-6), the Son in His redemption for the accomplishment of God's eternal purpose (vv. 7-12), and the Spirit in His sealing and pledging for the application of God's accomplished purpose (vv. 13-14). Through all the virtues of the Divine Trinity, we, the fallen sinners, become the church, the Body of Christ, the fullness, the expression, of the One who fills all in all.

**Ministry Excerpts** :

**In [1 Peter] 1:3 Peter uses the word "blessed." Paul also uses this word in Ephesians 1:3: "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ."**** In Greek the word blessed means well spoken of, praised with adoration. Hence, a blessing is a well-speaking **, and to bless someone is to speak well of him. Therefore, to bless God is to speak well concerning Him and all that He is to us, has done for us, and will do for us. To bless God is to speak in a sweet way of what God is, of what He has done, and of what He will do. This kind of speaking is a blessingâ€¦.Gradually the Lord has brought me into the thought of the divine revelation in the Bible. I can testify that when I read such a verse as 1:3,** I realize that to bless God the Father is to speak well of what God is to us subjectively **. It is not merely to praise Him for what He has done for us or given to us objectively.** To bless God the Father is to speak subjectively of what He is to us, of what He has done for us, and of what He will do for us. This is to bless God according to what is revealed in the New Testament**. (_Life-Study of 1 Peter,_ Chapter 10)

**We bless God, because God has blessed us. Because He has spoken so well concerning us, we return the well-speaking to Him.** For example, when we read about the redemption of our body, we should say, "God, how I thank You that You have come into me, that You are saturating me with Yourself, and that one day this saturation will be expressed through my body. That will be the day of the redemption of my body. God, how I thank You for this!" **To speak like this is to return the well-speaking to Him. Thus, He blesses you, and you bless Him. Learn to speak well concerning God according to His New Testament economy. After listening to God's well-speaking concerning us, we are qualified to speak well of Him.** (_Life-Study of Ephesians,_ Chapter 2)

We need to speak well concerning God according to the New Testament economy. In our well-speaking we need to have the thought of incarnation, the impartation of life, and the heavenly, spiritual transmission. We also need to include the thought of Christ as the Lord and the Head and of Jesus being Jehovah our Savior to accomplish redemption and salvation for us. We also need to think of Christ as God's anointed One who fully accomplishes God's purpose. **Our well-speaking, our high praise concerning God, should not be natural, but filled with the revelation of all the wonderful aspects of God's New Testament economy** . (_Life-Study of Ephesians,_ Chapter 2)

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 595** _

1. There is always something over,When we taste our gracious Lord;Every cup He fills o'erfloweth,Rich supply He doth afford.Nothing narrow, nothing stinted,Ever issued from His store;To His own He gives full measure,Running over, evermore,To His own He gives full measure,Running over, evermore.
2. There is always something over,When we, from the Father's hand,Take our portion with thanksgiving,Praising for the things He planned.Satisfaction, full and deepening,All our need He doth supply,When the heart has tasted JesusIts desires to satisfy,When the heart has tasted JesusIts desires to satisfy.
3. There is always something over,When we share in all His love;Unplumbed depths still lie beneath us,Unscaled heights rise far above.Human lips can never utterAll His wondrous tenderness.We can only praise and wonderAnd His Name forever bless,We can only praise and wonderAnd His Name forever bless.

_ **Hymn 661** _

1. Master, how shall I bless Thy nameFor love so great to me,For sweet enablings of Thy grace,So sov'reign, yet so free,That taught me to obey Thy word,And cast my care on Thee?
2. No anxious thought upon thy browThe watching world should see;No carefulness! O child of God,For nothing careful be!But cast thou all thy care on HimWho always cares for thee.
3. How shall I praise Thee, Savior dear,For this new life so sweet,For taking all the care I laidAt Thy beloved feet,Keeping Thy hand upon my heartTo still each anxious beat?

1. I long to praise Thee more, and yetThis is no care to me;If Thou shalt fill my mouth with songsThen I shall sing to Thee;And if my silence praise Thee best,Then silent I will be.
2. Yet if it be Thy will, dear Lord,Oh, send me forth to beThy messenger to careful hearts,To bid them taste, and seeHow good Thou art to those who castAll all their care on Thee.

_ **Hymn 79** _

1. All praise to Him who reigns on high,In majesty supreme,Who gave His life for man to die,That He might man redeem.

Blessed be the name,  
Blessed be the name,  
Blessed be the name of the Lord.  
Blessed be the name,  
Blessed be the name,  
Blessed be the name of the Lord.

1. His name above all names shall stand,Exalted more and more,At God the Father's own right hand,Where angel hosts adore.
2. Redeemer, Savior, Friend of manOnce ruined by the fall,Thou hast devised salvation's plan,For Thou hast died for all.
3. His name shall be the Counsellor,The mighty Prince of Peace,Of all earth's kingdoms, Conqueror,Whose reign shall never cease.

_ **Hymn 48, s. 1** _

We bless Thee, God and Father,  
We joy before Thy face;  
Beyond dark death for ever,  
We share Thy Son's blest place.  
He lives a Man before Thee,  
In cloudless light above,  
In Thine unbounded favor,  
Thine everlasting love.

79 - Bless
