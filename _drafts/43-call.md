**Scriptures** :

Gen. 4:26 And to Seth also a son was born, and he called his name Enosh. **At that time men began to call upon the name of Jehovah.**

Psa. 88:9b **I have called out to You, O Jehovah, every day** ; / I have spread out my hands to You.

Psa. 116:2 **Because He inclines His ear to me; / Therefore I will call upon Him all my days.**

Psa. 116:13 **I will take up the cup of salvation / And call upon the name of Jehovah.**

Psa. 145:18 **Jehovah is near to all who call upon Him, / To all who call upon Him in truth.**

Lam. 3:55 **I called upon Your name, O Jehovah,** / From the lowest pit. 56 You have heard my voice; **do not hide / Your ear at my breathing, at my cry** .

Acts 2:21 **And it shall be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved."**

Rom. 10:12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, **for the same Lord is Lord of all and rich to all who call upon Him** .

1 Cor. 1:2 To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints, **with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, who is theirs and ours** .

**Footnotes** :

Gen 4:26, note 2 (call) **The Hebrew word means to call out to, to cry unto, i.e., to cry out audibly** . Because men realized that their life was vanity (see note 21) and that they were frail and mortal (see note 261), they spontaneously began to call upon the name of Jehovah, the eternal One (see note 44 in ch. 2). **Although they were vain and weak, by calling on the name of the Lord, they were made rich and strong, for they entered into the riches and strength of the One on whom they called** (Rom. 10:12-13 and notes). See note 211 in Acts 2.

Act 2:21, note 2 The name denotes the person. **Jesus is the Lord's name, and the Spirit is His person. When we call, "Lord Jesus," we receive the Spirit.**

Act 2:21, note 3 This is the conclusion of the quotation of Joel's prophecy, which began in v. 17, indicating that the issue of God's pouring out of His Spirit upon all flesh is their salvation through calling on the name of the Lord. God's outpouring of His Spirit is the applying of the Lord's salvation to His chosen people. To be saved is to receive this Spirit, who is the blessing of the gospel in God's New Testament economy (Gal. 3:2, 5, 14). **This Spirit is the Lord Himself as the breath (John 20:22) and the living water (John 4:10, 14) to us. To breathe Him in as our breath and drink Him as our living water, we need to call on Him. Lamentations 3:55-56 indicates that our calling on the Lord is our breathing, and Isa. 12:3-4 indicates that our calling on the Lord is our drinking.** After we believe in the Lord, we need to call on Him that we may not only be saved but also enjoy His riches (Rom. 10:12-13). **When we exercise our spirit to call on Him, breathe Him in, and drink Him, we enjoy His riches; this is the real worship to God** . The Lord connected such worship (John 4:24) to the drinking of the living water given by Him (John 4:14).

Rom 10:13, note 1 **Calling on the name of the Lord is the secret not only to our salvation but also to our enjoyment of the Lord's riches. Beginning with Enosh, the third generation of mankind, and continuing all the way down to the New Testament believers, God's chosen and redeemed ones enjoyed Christ's redemption and salvation and all His riches by means of this secret** (see note 211 in Acts 2).

Rom 10:13, note 2 To be saved here means to be brought into the enjoyment of the riches of the Lord. The Lord is rich to both Jews and Greeks. **All who call on the Lord's name enjoy this rich Lord; as a result, they are filled with Him and express Him** .

**Ministry Excerpts** :

As we have seen already from Lamentations, our calling, "O Lord Jesus," is our breathing. Hymn #73 in Hymns was written by Miss M. E. Barber, an older sister who helped Brother Watchman Nee very much. Stanza 2 says, "Blessed Jesus! Mighty Savior! / In Thy Name is all I need; / Just to breathe the Name of Jesus, / Is to drink of Life indeed." Three or four years ago when I told the Lord's people that to breathe is to drink, I was a little doubtful. I had never heard anyone say this, and I thought that I might be too much. However, one night in Los Angeles this hymn was called. While we were singing, I was surprised at the lines which say, "Just to breathe the Name of Jesus, / Is to drink of Life indeed." At least one other person, Miss Barber, a sister who was deep in the Lord, experienced the same thing. **To call on the name of the Lord is to breathe Him, and to breathe Him is to drink of Him. The way to drink of the one Spirit is to call, "O Lord Jesus!" To call is to breathe, and to breathe is to drink, so to call is simply to drink.**** If you are thirsty, call on the Lord. At any time or any place, even while we are driving, we may be thirsty. Then we may call on the Lord and receive the living water. Try it; it always works. When we call on the name of the Lord, we drink of the Lord and we receive all the riches of the Lord** (_Enjoying the Riches of Christ for the Building Up of the Church as the Body of Christ,_ Chapter 12).

**I can testify from my own experience that if I do not call on the Lord, I cannot live.** But if I call on Him, everything is fine. Often when you greet a person and ask him how he is, he will answer, "Oh, I'm fine." Actually, for the most part, people are not fine. Only those who call on the Lord Jesus without ceasing can truly say that they are fine. Often we are troubled by little things in our daily life. The car may not start, or a shoelace may break. Such things can be aggravating and make us angry. When you are angry over a car that will not start or over a broken shoelace, can you honestly say that you are fine? I repeat, only those who call on the name of the Lord Jesus truly are fine.

There is no need always to call on the Lord purposely or deliberately. **We may call on Him subconsciously, unconsciously, and unintentionally. This is true breathing. Breathing is unintentional. Let us practice to build up a habit of calling on the Lord's name until we call unconsciously and unintentionally** .

**I encourage you to call on the Lord, saying, "Lord Jesus, I love You." As you enjoy the Lord in this way, you may weep out of a sense of His sweetness, loveliness, and preciousness. When we call on Him, He touches us inwardly. This is the true experience of living Christ by breathing the holy breath. May we all exercise ourselves more and more to receive and enjoy the holy breath** (_Life-study of Philippians,_ Chapter 34).

We believe in the processed, dispensing Triune God and realize that we have been regenerated, yet we may not breathe, drink, eat, or grow in a regular way. The root hairs of our Christian life should be like the countless root hairs of a tree. **All day long, we need to breathe in the Lord. Some saints may not call on the Lord for three days or even a month. As a result, there is no growth in the Lord with them because there are no root hairs. We need to call on the Lord all the time. This is why Paul tells us to pray unceasingly (1 Thes. 5:17). To pray is both to breathe and to drink. M.E. Barber said in a hymn that "to breathe the Name of Jesus is to drink of Life indeed" (Hymns, #73). We have to call, to pray, to breathe, to drink** . Then we have to eat the Lord. We also need to abide in the Lord that we may grow. If we take care of these life matters, we will be people who are in the divine dispensing of the divine Trinity to carry out the divine economy for the fulfillment of the divine purpose(_Messages to the Trainees in Fall 1990,_ Chapter 5).

_ **Hymn 1086** _

1. How we love the glorious name,The name of Jesus!'Tis the name above all names—On earth or in heav'n.As we breathe this precious name,Darkness and death cannot remain;For we call and get the Person of that name!

1. Dear Lord Jesus, with our tongues—We gladly confess Thy name,To the glory of the Father God above.For to us to speak Thy praise,Is the enjoyment of our days;Calling JESUS is to call the One we love!
