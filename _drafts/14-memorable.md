memorial

**Scriptures**** :**

Exo. 12:14 **And this day will be a memorial to you** , and you shall keep it as a feast to Jehovah; throughout your generations as a perpetual statute you shall keep it as a feast.

Exo. 13:9 **And it shall be for a sign to you upon your hand and for a memorial between your eyes, that the law of Jehovah may be in your mouth** ; for with a mighty hand Jehovah brought you out of Egypt.

Exo. 16:32 And Moses said, This is what Jehovah has commanded, Let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out from the land of Egypt.

Exo. 16:33 And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and **put an omerful of manna in it, and place it before Jehovah, to be kept throughout your generations** .

Josh. 4:7 You shall tell them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah; when it crossed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. **Thus these stones will be for a memorial to the children of Israel forever.**

**Footnotes** :

Exo 12:14, note 1 (memorial) This indicates that **we should remember Christ's redemption perpetually in a specific and detailed way** .

Exo 13:9, note 1 (memorial) Those who are sanctified by taking Christ as their Substitute (v. 2), who have a new beginning of life (v. 4), and who eliminate all exposed sin (vv. 6-7) will have a daily living that is worthy of being a memorial, an eternal remembrance.

Exo 16:32, note 1 (omerful) The open manna, the manna that lay on the ground every morning, was for the enjoyment of God's people in a public way. However, the omer of manna placed in a pot (v. 33) was hidden and was not for the congregation in a public way. The amount of manna kept in a pot before Jehovah was one omer, the same as the amount gathered and eaten by the people (vv. 16-18). In spiritual experience, this indicates that the amount of Christ we eat is the amount we can preserve. The Christ whom we eat as open manna spontaneously becomes hidden manna by being digested and assimilated into our inner being. Furthermore, **whatever we eat of Christ will become a memorial in generations to come. The Christ whom we eat and enjoy will be an eternal memorial, because such a Christ becomes our very constitution, enabling us to build up and even to become God's dwelling place in the universe** .

**Ministry Excerpts** :

If God leads you to walk a way that you know, it will not benefit you as much as if He would lead you to take the way that you do not know. This forces you to have hundreds and thousands of conversations with Him, **resulting in a journey that is an everlasting memorial between you and Him** . (_Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 07: The Christian (5),_ Chapter 23)

We today are God's tabernacle. As the tabernacle, we have the ark, Christ, in our spirit. We have pointed out again and again that the golden pot is in the ark and that the manna is in the golden pot. In our experience we enjoy three precious things: the ark, the golden pot, and the manna. **How subjective is Christ as the hidden manna! He is the manna we have taken in and enjoyed. This manna will be preserved as a memorial for eternity** . What you enjoy of Christ will be preserved in the divine nature for eternity. I believe that when we enter into eternity we shall become more clear concerning this.

The picture of the preserving of the manna in the golden pot is related to our experience of Christ. Because many Christians do not grasp the significance of this picture, they only realize that manna is good for food. **They have no idea that the manna we enjoy is to be preserved as a memorial in the divine nature within us** . We thank the Lord for the picture at the end of Exodus 16. This picture portrays the experience of Christ as manna. If we eat Christ as manna, the manna we eat will be preserved in the divine nature within us. This hidden manna is a memorial of Christ as the supply to God's people for the building of God's dwelling place. Such a memorial will be a remembrance for eternity. Everything else may change, but **our experience of Christ will remain for eternity. What we enjoy of Christ today will become a memorial in the future. Whatever we eat of Him will be preserved in the divine nature as an eternal memorial** . (_Life-Study of Exodus_, Chapter 39)

**The fact that the Christ we eat is the Christ we preserve indicates that whatever we eat of Christ will become a memorial in generations to come. Only the Christ we have eaten and experienced is worthy of remembrance** . The Christ whom we enjoy will be an eternal memorial, because the Christ we experience and enjoy becomes our very constitution. He actually becomes the reconstituting element for God's people, that element which causes them to be reconstituted. Nothing of what we are, what we have, or what we can do is worthy of remembrance. **Only the Christ who has become our constitution is worthy to be an eternal memorial. What we remember in eternity will be nothing other than Christ. For generation after generation, Christ will be our memoria** l. _(Life-Study of Exodus,_ Chapter 38)

**I am concerned that many Christians will have very little to remember when they are in the New Jerusalem. But if we live with Christ as our substitute, have a new beginning of life, and deal with all exposed sin, we shall have a great deal to remember in eternity. Every day we live in this way is a day worth remembering. It is possible for every day of our Christian life to be a memorial** . May the Lord save us from having to repent over wasted days, days in which there is no new beginning of life and no thorough dealing with leaven. After we have been saved through Christ as our Passover lamb, we need to take Him as our substitute for the beginning of a new, sinless life. Then we shall have many days of memorial.

In this new beginning of life there must be no leaven. We have pointed out that in the Bible leaven signifies sinfulness or corruption. We need to deal with all sin that is exposed. We must not tolerate any sin after it has been exposed. **To eat unleavened bread in this way is to have a true memorial to the Lord, a genuine remembrance. Those who are sanctified by having Christ as their substitute and who have a new beginning of life without sin will have a daily living that is worthy of being a memorial** . If we have a proper experience of God's salvation, we shall have a marvelous spiritual history. After our Passover, we shall be sanctified to the Lord by taking Christ as our substitute to live in us. Then we shall have a new beginning of life, and all exposed sin will be dealt with. Such a living will be a memorial, a remembrance. **Every day we live this kind of life will be a day of memorial. In our Christian life every day should be such a memorial day** . Any day that is not a memorial is a day of defeat. (_Life-Study of Exodus_, Chapter 27)

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 232, ss. 1, 2** _

1By Christ redeemed, in Christ restored,

We keep the memory adored,

And show the death of our dear Lord

Until He come.

2 His body broken in our stead

Is seen in this memorial bread,

And so our feeble love is fed

Until He come.

_ **Hymn 214, ss. 1, 2** _

1 According to Thy gracious word,

In meek humility,

This will I do, my dying Lord,

I will remember Thee.

2Thy body, broken for my sake,

My bread from heaven shall be;

Thy testamental cup I take,

And thus remember Thee.
