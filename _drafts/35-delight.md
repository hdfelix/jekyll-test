take great pleasure or enjoyment

**Scriptures** :

Job 27:10 Does he **take delight in the Almighty** ? / Will he call upon God at all times?

Isa. 58:2 Yet they seek Me day by day / And **take delight in knowing My ways** , / Like a nation that has done righteousness / And has not forsaken the ordinance of their God. / They ask Me for righteous judgments; / **They take delight in approaching God.**

Isa. 58:14 **Then you will have delight in Jehovah; / And I will cause you to ride upon the heights of the earth** , / And I will feed you with the inheritance of Jacob your father; / For the mouth of Jehovah has spoken.

Psa. 37:4 **Delight yourself in Jehovah** , / And He will give you the requests of your heart.

Psa. 40:8 **I delight in doing Your will, O My God;** / Indeed Your law is within My inward parts.

Psa. 119:16 **I will take delight in Your statutes;** / I will not forget Your word.

Psa. 119:24 **Also Your testimonies are my delight** ; / They are my counselors.

S. S. 2:3 As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, / So is my beloved among the sons: **In his shade I delighted and sat down** , / And his fruit was sweet to my taste.

**Footnotes** :

S.S. 2:3, note 1 The lover appreciates Christ as the source of rich provision (apple tree) who supplies her in a timely way. **She is satisfied with her delight in resting (sitting down) under Christ as an overshadowing canopy in the day (shade—Isa. 4:5-6; 2 Cor. 12:9) and with her tasting Him as the sweet, timely supply (sweet fruit).**

**Ministry Excerpts** :

Our heart is the organ of our inclination and affection toward things; it represents us with regard to our inclination, affection, delight, and desire toward things. **All our inclination, affection, delight, and desire are functions of our heart.** Before we were regenerated, our heart was inclined toward sin, loved the world, and desired the things of passion; toward God, however, it was cold and hard, without inclination and without affection; toward the things of God and spiritual things, it had no delight and was void of any desire. **So when God regenerates us, He renews our heart and makes our heart a new heart, with a new inclination, new affection, new delight, and new desire. Thus, once we are regenerated and saved, our heart inclines toward God, loves God, and desires God; toward the things of God, the spiritual things, and the heavenly things, it also has delight and desire** . Whenever such things are mentioned, our heart is joyful, responsive, and desirous. (The Knowledge of Life, p. 37)

Today we are not merely under God's mercy, but we are the object of His grace in the position of grace. **We are enjoying Him and becoming His enjoyment. Hence, there is a mutual delight, mutual enjoyment, and mutual satisfaction** (_Life-Study of Ephesians,_ Chapter 5).

"As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved… I sat down under His shadow with great delight." **We can sit under Him as the shade—under His covering and shadow—and enjoy all His riches,** the fruit of the tree (_Man and the Two Trees,_ Chapter 1).

In today's Christianity much is said about serving, worshipping, and working for God. But we must see that we need to enjoy God. Some may even criticize us by saying, "These people do not go out to work for the Lord. They just talk about eating and enjoyment. This is too selfish. They are just for themselves and do not care for others. They do not have the outreach for the salvation of sinners." We need to see that we can have much service with many programs and activities without much result. The work must be the fruit of the enjoyment of God. In John 15 the Lord said, "Abide in Me and I in you"; then you will bear fruit (vv. 4-5). The work comes out of the full enjoyment of God. **We must be brought back to the realization and understanding that we need God as our enjoyment. We have to know the items of God as our enjoyment and the way that we can enjoy Him.** We also have to help others to know how to enjoy God. Then we will all be filled with Him and some fruit will be produced. That will be the proper work, the proper activity (_The Enjoyment of Christ_, Chapter 1).

**It is God's commandment and desire that His people call on Him. It is the joyful way to drink from the fountain of God's salvation and the enjoyable way to delight oneself in God, that is, to enjoy Him** . Hence, God's people must call upon Him daily…. **It is vitally necessary for us, the believers in Christ, to participate in and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ with all He has accomplished, attained, and obtained** (_Life-Study of Acts,_ Chapter 9).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 405** _

1Having seen the world's fair beauty,

Lord, I would be blind once more,

Lest I lose the loving Presence

And Delight I knew before.

Having seen the world's fair beauty,

Lord, I would be blind once more,

Lest I lose the loving Presence

And Delight I knew before.

2Dawn and sunset, star and moonlight,

I can see in paradise,

But while here on earth His mercy

For my blindness will suffice.

3I no more would be delivered

From my thorn, but look for grace,

While within the veil His glory

Shineth brightly on my face.

4In the deep dark night, His beauty

I by faith, not sight, may trace;

He was ridiculed and hated,

Yet I see His glorious face.

5Sun and moonlight far surpassing,

Clouds and Milky Way o'erspread,

Is the glory all transcending

Shining from His thorn-crowned head.

_ **Hymn 812** _

1I come to Thee, dear Lord,

My heart doth thirst for Thee;

Of Thee I'd eat, of Thee I'd drink.

Enjoy Thee thoroughly.

2Just to behold Thy face,

For this my heart doth cry;

I deeply long to drink of Thee

My thirst to satisfy.

3Thy glorious, radiant face

My heart delights to see;

Here I'd abide and ne'er depart,

Beholding constantly.

4In such a fellowship

Thou, Lord, art grace to me;

My heart and spirit gladdened, filled,

I enter rest in Thee.

5Lord, I would linger here,

Still seeking after Thee,

Continue in the Word and prayer

Till Thou dost flow thru me.

_ **Hymn 554** _

1I come to His presence afresh

Ere the night has passed into morning;

And His face I see as it shines on me-

The Lord within is dawning.

And He speaks to me and reveals to me

All His riches for me today;

And with sweet delight I partake of Him,

My hunger has passed away.

2As Spirit He speaks thru the Word

Till my heart in echo is singing,

And the fount of life with His grace and pow'r

Within my soul is springing.

And He speaks to me and reveals to me

All His riches for me today;

And I drink of Him for my every need,

My thirsting has passed away.

3In tenderness He deals with me,

While I stay with joy in His presence;

And He saturates and supplies my soul

With all His precious essence.

And He speaks to me and reveals to me

All His riches for me today;

And in every way I partake of Him,

My problems all passed away.

_ **Hymn 671** _

1Deep down into the depths of this Thy Name,

My God, I sink and dwell in calm delight;

Thou art enough however long the day,

Thou art enough however dark the night.

2Thou art my God—the All-Sufficient One,

Thou canst create for me whate'er I lack;

Thy mighty hand has strewn the lonely track

With miracles of love and tender care.

3For me Thy trusting one. My God I dare

Once more to fling myself upon Thy breast,

And there adore Thy ways in faith's deep rest,

And there adore Thy ways in faith's quiet rest.
