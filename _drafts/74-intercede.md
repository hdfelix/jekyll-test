**Scriptures** :

Gen. 18:24 Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city; will You indeed destroy and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous who are in it?: 25 Far be it from You to do such a thing, to put to death the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be as the wicked. Far be it from You! Shall the Judge of all the earth not do justly? …33 And Jehovah went away as soon as He had finished speaking with Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.

Rom. 1:9 For God is my witness, whom I serve **in my spirit** in the gospel of His Son, **how unceasingly I make mention of you always in my prayers** .

1 Tim. 2:1 I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers, **intercessions, thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men** ;

Philem. 4 **I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers** .

**Footnotes** :

Gen. 18:221 **Abraham's purpose in standing before Jehovah was to intercede for Lot** . **The glorious intercession that Abraham made before God was not a prayer from man on earth to God in heaven; it was a human conversation between two friends, an intimate talk according to the unveiling of God's heart's desire** .

Gen 18:251 **In Abraham's intercession for Lot, He did not beg God according to His love and grace; he challenged God according to His righteous way** . God's righteousness binds Him much more than His love and grace do (see note 171 in Rom. 1).

Gen 18:331 **Abraham's intercession did not terminate with Abraham's speaking but with God's,**** showing that genuine intercession is God's speaking in our speaking**.

Exo. 30:102, par. 2 In Exodus the incense altar is revealed after the tabernacle and its furniture and the equipping of the priesthood are revealed. **This indicates that the priestly service begins at the incense altar, at the place where prayers of intercession are offered to God** (Luke 1:10). The incense altar is the place from which the activities at all the other places in the tabernacle are motivated. It is not merely one item on the passageway through the tabernacle. Rather, it can be compared to a motor that causes everything to operate. Hence, in our experience of the tabernacle (see note 43 in Heb. 9), the incense altar stands by itself as a turning point. It makes all the aspects of the tabernacle and the outer court effective in our experience. **The prayer of intercession also motivates others to come to Christ at the altar of burnt offering, at the laver, at the table, at the lampstand, and at the Ark in the Holy of Holies** . According to Rev. 8:3, the incense altar is directly in front of the throne of God's authority, which is also the throne of grace (see note 22 in Rev. 4). The prayer offered at the incense altar, a prayer that is offered in Christ and with Christ as the incense (see note 71), governs God's dispensing of grace and motivates the execution of the divine administration. Hence, this prayer governs the universe.

Exo 30:71 Burning the incense typifies praying (Psa. 141:2; Luke 1:10-11; Rev. 8:3-4). The incense typifies the resurrected and ascended Christ (see note 351 in this chapter and note 34 in Rev. 8). **Hence, to burn the incense is to pray Christ, to pray in Christ and with Christ as the incense. This kind of prayer is intercessory prayer, not prayer for ourselves but prayer for the carrying out of the divine administration, for the dispensing of God's supplying grace, and for the churches and the saints. Such prayer is a fragrant incense to God—it fulfills His purpose, satisfies His desire, and delights His heart.**

1Tim. 2:12 **(intercessions) The Greek word denotes an approaching of God in a personal and confiding manner, i.e., an intervening, an interfering, before God in others' affairs for their benefit** .

**Ministry Excerpts** :

What was God's purpose in coming to Abraham in Genesis 18? He surely did not come for a meal; neither did He come to confirm His promise regarding Sarah's giving birth to a son. **God came to Abraham because He was seeking an intercessor.** On His throne in heaven, God had decided to execute His judgment on the wicked city of Sodom. But God would never forget that one of His people, Lot, was in that city. Lot did not even realize that he had to be rescued from Sodom. **What could God do? He had to find someone to intercede for Lot.** God knew that there was no one on earth who was as concerned for Lot and who was so much with God as Abraham was. Hence, **God came to Abraham for the purpose of finding an intercessor. Without an intercessor to intercede for His people, God cannot do anything. God has His divine principles. One of them is that without intercession He cannot save anyone. The salvation of every Christian has been accomplished through intercession.** God did not stay on His throne in heaven waiting for such intercession to occur. Rather, He came down to visit Abraham in the form of a mortal man so that Abraham might easily talk with Him and intercede for Lot. In Genesis 18 Abraham did not pray to God or call on the name of God; he talked to God as with an intimate friend. **Thus, the purpose of God's visit to Abraham in this chapter was that Abraham might take up the burden to intercede for Lot according to God's desire.** (_Abraham—Called by God,_ Chapter 15, Section 1)

**I say once again that proper intercession must always be initiated by God's visitation on the human level.**** Whenever we have the deep sense that God has come to us on a human level, we shall realize that this is the time when God will initiate an intercession for us to carry out. For this we must learn to linger in the presence of God. **If He would begin to walk away, we must stay in His presence and tell Him, "Lord, I don't want to lose Your presence. I want to linger here with You." Your lingering in His presence will open up His heart and draw out His desire. We have seen that Abraham did not abruptly say good-bye to the Lord but walked with Him for a certain distance. This reveals that, in a certain sense, God is very human. If we would linger in His presence, He would be so human as not to leave us. He would remain with us because of our lingering with Him. I have experienced this many times. I did not leave God's presence and He did not leave mine.** As a result of that lingering, God opened His heart to me and the proper intercession came forth.** (_Abraham—Called by God,_ Chapter 15, Section 3)

**If we are so close to God, fellowshipping with Him in an intimate way, we shall be able to read His heart and echo His heart's desire back to Him in a glorious intercession.** (_Abraham—Called by God,_ Chapter 15, Section 4)

**Proper intercession always expresses God's desire. This is another principle of intercession. If our intercession is initiated by our seeing of God's revelation in our intimate fellowship with Him, whatever we say to Him in our intercession will be the expression of His desire, the echo of His intention.** True intercession is not to express our desire but God's desire. It is not to seek anything according to our intention but to seek the fulfillment of God's intention. (_Abraham—Called by God_, Chapter 15)

**If we want to learn the work of intercession, we must learn to turn to our spirit, enter into God, drop our concepts, and care for God's heart** . When we do this, spontaneously He will show us His desire, and He will motivate us to pray. The more we pray this way, the more we will touch God's heart. We will touch God and be filled, and something solid will remain in us. After we pray this way, we will have the faith and the deep assurance that our prayers have been answered. **Intercession is fully a matter of being in the spirit.** (_How to Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God_, Chapter 21)

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 785 (alternate tune)** _

1Praying to express the Lord,

We must not ourselves express,

But let Christ reveal Himself,

His desire in us impress.

2Praying to express the Lord,

We must utter His intent,

Quieting our human thoughts

That with His our mind be blent.

3Praying to express the Lord,

Ever looking unto Him

As a mirror to reflect

All His glory from within.

4Praying to express the Lord,

Letting Him beseech in us;

Christ indwelling prays within

To the Christ in heaven thus.

5Praying to express the Lord,

Learning not to pray by self,

Praying wholly with the Lord,

Praying only by Himself.

_ **Hymn 768** _

1. Lord, teach us to useThe intercessor's rod,As Moses did of oldUpon the hill of God.
2. Before the upstayed armThe ranks of darkness quailed!In great Jehovah's NameThe hosts of light prevailed!
3. Teach us to bind the foeWith iron chains of prayer,That all Thy Church may moveTo victory everywhere.

1. Give us the steady arm,Until the sun go down,That we in Christ may winThe overcomer's crown.
