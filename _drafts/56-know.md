**Scriptures** :

Jer. 31:34 And they will no longer teach, each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; **for all of them will know Me, from the little one among them even to the great one among them** , declares Jehovah, for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more.

Matt. 11:27 All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one fully knows the Son except the Father; **neither does anyone fully know the Father except the Son and him to whom the Son wills to reveal Him** .

John 17:3 **And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ** .

Phil. 3:8 But moreover I also count all things to be loss on account of **the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord** , on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ 10 **To know Him** and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.

1 John 5:20 **And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding that we might know Him who is true;** and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.

**Footnotes** :

Jer. 31:341 **To know God is to live God** . **Through the spontaneous, automatic function of the divine life within us, we have the capacity to know God, to live God, and even to be one with God** in His life and nature so that we may be His corporate expression. See note 31 in John 17.

John 17:31 **Eternal life is the divine life with a special function, that is, to know God and Christ** (cf. Matt. 11:27). God and Christ are divine. **To know the divine person, we need the divine life. Since the believers are born of the divine life, they know God and Christ** (Heb. 8:11; Phil. 3:10).

Matt. 11:272 **Full knowledge** , not mere objective acquaintance. Concerning the Son, only the Father has such knowledge, and **concerning the Father, only the Son and he to whom the Son reveals Him have such knowledge** . Hence, **to know the Son requires that the Father reveal Him (16:17), and to know the Father requires that the Son reveal Him (John 17:6, 26)** .

1 John 5:202 (understanding) The faculty of our mind enlightened and empowered by the Spirit of reality (John 16:12-15) to apprehend the divine reality in our regenerated spirit.

1 John 5:202 (know) **This is the ability of the divine life to know the true God (John 17:3) in our regenerated spirit** (Eph. 1:17) through our renewed mind, enlightened by the Spirit of reality.

**Ministry Excerpts** :

In [John 17:] 3 the Lord said, "And **this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ.** " What is eternal life? When I was young, I was told that eternal life was just a blessing in the future. **Eternal life is divine life with a special function—to know God (cf. Matt. 11:27) and Christ** . Every life has its function. The function of a dog's life is barking, the function of a bird's life is flying, the function of a cat's life is catching mice, and the function of a chicken's life is laying eggs. **The function of the divine life is to know God. God and Christ are divine. To know the divine person we need the divine life. Since the believers are born with the divine life, they know God and Christ (Heb. 8:11; Phil. 3:10)** . Hebrews 8:11 says that there is no need to teach any New Testament believers to know God. Why is there no need for this? Because every New Testament believer knows God. New Testament believers have the divine life, and the divine life is the life that knows God. We do not need to teach a dog to bark, because the dog's life has the barking function. Likewise, since we have the divine life, we do not need to be taught to know God, for the function of the divine life is to know God and Christ. **Oh, that I may know Christ! We all may know Christ because we have the divine life, the life whose function is to know God and Christ** . (_Life-Study of John_, Message 38, pp. 466-467)

To have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ in [Phil. 3:] 8 is by revelation. But to know Him in verse 10 is by experience—to have the experiential knowledge of Him, to experience Him in the full knowledge of Him. Paul first received the revelation of Christ and then sought for the experience of Christ—to know and enjoy Him in an experiential way.

After we receive the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, we shall be willing to suffer the loss of all things and count them refuse in order to gain Christ and be found in Him. As a result, we shall know Christ experientially. Therefore, verse 9 comes out of verse 8, and verse 10 comes out of verse 9. If we do not have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ (v. 8), we shall not be found in Christ, for it is having the excellency of the knowledge of Christ which makes us willing to suffer the loss of all things and count them as refuse in order to gain Christ and be found in Him. Then, once we have gained Christ and are found in Him, we shall know Him; that is, we shall enjoy Him and experience Him.

To gain Christ is one thing, and to experience Him is another. We may illustrate this difference by the difference between buying groceries and eating food which has been purchased and prepared. Gaining Christ may be compared to buying groceries, and the experience of Christ may be compared to the eating of the food we have first purchased and cooked. However, before we buy any groceries, we must first have the excellency of the knowledge of groceries. Before we purchase anything, we are first attracted by the excellency of the knowledge of that thing. Thus, first we have the excellency of the knowledge of the groceries, then we gain them by buying them, and finally we enjoy the food by eating it. In like manner, Paul first received the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, then he paid the price to gain Christ and be found in Him, and finally he experienced Christ and enjoyed Him. Paul realized that to gain Christ and be found in Him always results in knowing Him, in enjoying and experiencing Him.

Our experience of Christ can never surpass the excellency of our knowledge of Christ. Rather, the excellency of the knowledge of Christ always exceeds our experience of Christ. There has never been a case where a believer's experience of Christ surpassed his knowledge of Christ. If we do not have a higher knowledge of Christ, we cannot have a higher experience of Christ. This is why it is very important that we not be limited by our past knowledge of Christ.

You may know that Christ is joy, peace, and rest. Before you were saved, you did not have the peace. But now that you have received the Lord, you have peace and joy. By no means do I belittle these aspects of the knowledge of Christ. I certainly enjoy the Lord Jesus as my peace, rest, and joy. Nevertheless, we should not be content with such a limited knowledge of Christ, but should advance in our knowledge of Him. Oh, how we need the excellency of knowing Christ!

The excellency of the knowledge of Christ will attract us to Christ and motivate us to lay aside everything other than Him. If we see the surpassing worth of Christ, we shall be willing to count as loss not only worldly, material things, but even our culture, religion, and philosophy. I repeat, it is the excellency of the knowledge of Christ which causes us to drop everything else so that we may gain Christ and be found in Him. (_Life-Study of Philippians_, Message 21, pp. 172-173)
