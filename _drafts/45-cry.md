**Scriptures** :

**Psa. 39:12**** Hear my prayer, O Jehovah; / And give ear to my cry; / Do not hold Your peace at my tears.** / For I am a stranger with You, / A sojourner, as all my fathers were.

**Psa 84:6 - Passing through the valley of Baca [weeping], / They make it a spring; /** Indeed the early rain covers it with blessings.

**Psa. 126:5**** Those who sow in tears / Will reap with a ringing shout **. 6** He who goes forth and weeps, / Bearing seed for scattering, / Will no doubt come in with a ringing shout**, / Bearing his sheaves with him.

Mark 9:24 Immediately, **crying out,** the father of the child said, I believe; help my unbelief!

**Luke 7:38 And she stood behind Him at His feet weeping and began to wet His feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head** , and she kissed His feet affectionately and anointed them with the ointment.

**Luke 18:7** And **will not God by all means carry out the avenging of His chosen ones, who cry to Him day and night** , though He is long-suffering over them?

Heb. 5:7 This One, **in the days of His flesh, having offered up both petitions and supplications with strong crying and tears to Him who was able to save Him out of death** and having been heard because of His piety.

**Footnotes** :

1 Chron. 5:20, note 1 (cried) The children of Reuben, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh crying out to God that they might defeat their enemies and possess their land is a pattern for us today. **We too should cry out to God, telling Him that we want to gain more of Christ, possess more of Christ, and enjoy more of Christ as our God-allotted portion** (Col. 1:12). See note 101 in ch. 4.

Psa. 84:6, note 2 **When we pass through the valley of Baca, God makes this valley a spring** (cf. Col. 1:24; Heb. 10:34). This spring is the Spirit (John 4:14; 7:38-39). **The more we weep on the highways to Zion, the more we receive the Spirit. While we are weeping, we are being filled with the Spirit, and the Spirit becomes our spring** .

Psa. 84:6, note 3 **Those who come into the church life by passing through the valley of weeping find that this weeping eventually becomes a great blessing to them. This blessing is the Spirit (Gal. 3:14). The tears they shed are their own, but these tears issue in a spring, which becomes the early rain, the Spirit as the blessing** .

**Ministry Excerpts** :

Let us read the story of a father and his son, and **we will understand immediately the profit of praying with tears before God.** Mark 9:24 says, "Immediately, crying out, the father of the child said, I believe; help my unbelief!" At that time, it was too painful for him. He hated the fact that he could not believe, or that his faith was not enough. On one hand, he saw his child in pain and could not make him better in spite of all that he had done. On the other hand, he sought for the help of the Lord's disciples, and they were unable to do anything. He was indeed frustrated. **Under such anxiety and pain, he could not contain himself; he had to cry and call on the Lord. What was the result? The Lord heard his prayer, and the child was healed. There is a reason for many prayers not being answered.**** It is because there are no tears**. (_Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 19: Notes on Scriptural Messages (3),_ Chapter 5, Section 5)

Of course, weeping before men is a manifestation of your weakness, but **a person ought to shed tears unto God. I have often said that whoever has shed tears before God is blessed. On the other hand, whoever has never shed tears before God does not know the meaning of fellowship. Neither does he know about being close to God or casting his burden on the Lord** . A friend of mine once told me something regarding tears. He said, "When all your ways are blocked, when you are opposed in every place, when everyone says you are wrong, and when the environment vexes you, drop a few tears before God. This is your only way out. Only this will enable you to solve the problem." This statement is true. Whoever has passed through the same experience would say the same thing. These are unavoidable experiences, and every believer must pass through them. If you want to serve God faithfully and live in a godly way, things of this kind will surely happen to you, and tears will surely flow. **There has never been a faithful one who has not shed tears. Brothers and sisters, how about you? If you have ever brought your problems or joys to God, I advise you to bring your tears to Him as well** .

Psalm 6:6 says, "I cause my bed to swim all night long; / With my tears I dissolve my couch." At that time David was in the midst of adversity. Furthermore, his body was not strong. Therefore, he wept every night; his couch was wet, and his bed was made to swim. Let me say something that is not pleasing to the ears: **whoever can only laugh but cannot weep, is a very shallow person** . Whoever laughs all day long shows that within him he does not have much depth. **Those who have never wept have never passed through God's digging hands. Tears indicate that a person has something within him. They show others that there is God's work within such a person** . However, God does not treasure our tears that are shed in public, tears that others can see. **He treasures the tears shed in secret, tears that are shed for Him. Proper and precious tears are tears "unto God," tears shed at night** . We know that David was a person who knew how to cry very well. Psalms tells us that he wept many times. Whenever he sinned or encountered adversity, he would shed his tears before God. But Saul was not such a person. He could only become angry and vexed; he could not weep… **The reason David was led by God to such deep and full experiences was that he shed tears** . The many tears that he shed reveal the many sufferings and adversities that he bore. Many lessons are learned from suffering. As Romans says, "Tribulation produces endurance" (5:3). Let us remember that David became David because of his tears. If there had been no tears to cultivate him, he could not have been any deeper than others were.

… **Therefore, tears are the real meaning of human life.** They show that a person still bears his human nature and still has the sense of sin. Wherever sin is, tears must also be present. Heart-breaking experiences, sorrowful events, and recollections of the past can all cause us to shed tears. The reason many people cannot shed tears is that they have forgotten their past history, they have left paradise and do not know where they are today. **The same applies to man's experience of God's redemption; without the shedding of tears, man cannot return to the beginning. Anyone who has forgotten what he has passed through cannot shed tears. The shedding of tears is an indication that a person feels pain concerning his past** . (_Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 19: Notes on Scriptural Messages (3),_ Chapter 5, Section 3)

**Tears have a cleansing function, not only in the physical realm, but also in the spiritual realm. A few more tears allow a person to see a little more clearly. Without tears our spiritual eyes will lose their function** . (_Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 19: Notes on Scriptural Messages (3),_ Chapter 5, Section 1)

**We pointed out that we need to go to the Lord individually to be stirred up in the first love for the Lord through repenting prayers. We need to make a thorough confession to the Lord. In our time with the Lord, we may say with tears, "Lord, I repent. I'm so sinful and dirty** ." I have been practicing this for close to seventy years. We all have to learn the lesson in our prayer not to teach the Lord. Mostly we should not ask the Lord to do something for us. **Instead, we should cry out desperately from the depths of our being, "Lord, I'm sinful! I need You, Lord."** The Bible even says that some beat their breast when they made their confession to the Lord (Luke 18:13).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 1054** _

1. Pass me not, O gentle Savior,Hear my humble cry;While on others Thou art calling,Do not pass me by.

Savior, Savior,  
Hear my humble cry;  
While on others Thou art calling,  
Do not pass me by.

1. Let me at Thy throne of mercyFind a sweet relief;Kneeling there in deep contrition,Help my unbelief.

1. Trusting only in Thy merit,Would I seek Thy face;Heal my wounded, broken spirit,Save me by Thy grace.

1. Thou the spring of all my comfort,More than life to me;Whom have I on earth beside Thee?Whom in heaven but Thee?

_ **Let Me Stand Behind You Lord, s. 1** _

Let me stand behind You, Lord.  
Let me wash Your feet with my tears.  
Let me wipe them with my hair.  
Let me kiss them and anoint them  
With the ointment.

I love You!  
Jesus, I love You!  
May I waste my all and life on You.  
Let me pour the ointment pure  
On Your head and on Your feet,  
On You, most precious One  
Because I love You.

_ **Hymn 1158, s. 4** _

Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,  
Thy way only will I choose;  
Though in tears while I'm obeying,  
Yet I would not change my standing;  
All I long for is Thy pleasure,  
And the peace Thy love would bring.
