poor, unloaded

**Scriptures** :

2 Kings 4:2 And Elisha said to her, What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in your house? And she said, Your servant has nothing at all in the house, except a jar of oil. 3 And he said, Go and borrow vessels outside, from all your neighbors, empty vessels, and not just a few. 4 Then go in and shut the door behind you and your sons, and pour out into all those vessels; and each one you fill set aside. 5 So she went away from him and shut the door behind herself and her sons; and they brought the vessels to her, and she poured out into them. 6 And when she had filled the vessels, she said to her son, Bring me another vessel. But he said to her, There is no other vessel. And the oil stopped.

Isa. 66:2 For all these things My hand has made, / And so all these things have come into being, declares Jehovah. / But **to this kind of man will I look, to him who is poor / And of a contrite spirit, and who trembles at My word** .

Matt. 5:3 **Blessed are the poor in spirit** , for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.

Luke 1:53 - **The hungry He has filled with good things** , and the rich He has sent away empty.

**Footnotes**** :**

Matt. 5:3, note 2 **To be poor in spirit is not only to be humble but also to be emptied in our spirit, in the depth of our being, not holding on to the old things of the old dispensation but unloaded to receive the new things, the things of the kingdom of the heavens.**

**Ministry Excerpts** :

**God will use only you, not what you have or can do. Therefore, you must empty yourself. To empty yourself means to have an absolute openness to God. The real openness to God means emptiness** . You may say you are open, but you are filled. A jar may be open, but it may be filled with sand. You may say that you are open to the Lord. **You may be open, but you are not empty** . There has never been an unloading. What part of you needs to be unloaded? Your capability, your knowledge, your wisdom, your education. It is only when you are empty that God can come in to fill you… **The problem is that we are not emptied and therefore cannot be filled with the Triune God as the filling Spirit today** . The problem is our education, our knowledge, our experience… you have had many experiences. **But even real experiences of the church life have to be emptied out** … **God cannot build His dwelling place by Himself; He can do it only through willing and empty vessels** . Whether the church is living and fresh and enriched depends on this one thing: that we are being filled continuously with the Triune God. For this, dear brothers, we need firstly the willingness and secondly the emptiness (_Practical Talks to the Elders,_ Chapter 7).

We need to pray and ask the Lord to dig more deeply in us and make more room in us so that the Holy Spirit can fill us. **The filling of the Holy Spirit depends on our emptiness. I will repeat: our emptiness ought to be a continuous state** . If we cannot empty ourselves, God cannot fill us. **The Holy Spirit is waiting for empty rooms within us** . The more empty rooms we give to Him, the more He will fill us. If there is empty room, it means there is more filling by the Holy Spirit to come. **Therefore, we need not seek for the filling; all we have to do is to empty ourselves** . The Holy Spirit alone is responsible for the filling; **our responsibility is to empty ourselves. If we can empty ourselves, we will have the filling** . We may not be conscious of the filling, but the fact of the filling will certainly be with us (_Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 37: General Messages (1_), Chapter 23).

At this point I would like to bring one thing to our attention. **What is the necessary condition for experiencing the Lord's riches?** In other words, what is the necessary condition for receiving God's blessing or the working of the Holy Spirit? This is something we must see; it is a condition which we must fulfill. If we do not meet this condition, we cannot expect to receive anything from the Lord. **This necessary condition is being empty before God. If we want to be filled with the Lord's riches continually, we have to be emptied continually** . **The emptying experience is an ever-deepening experience** . Therefore, we can never say that we are completely empty or that we cannot be emptied any further. **Brothers and sisters, we need to be emptied day after day, month after month, and year after year** . We may be empty now, but after some time we will need a further emptying work. We should not think that once we are emptied, we will be empty forever. We also should not think that once we are filled, we will be filled forever. We should have an ever-deepening knowledge of ourselves, and we should have an ever-deepening knowledge of the riches of the Lord.

The story in 2 Kings 4 shows us an important spiritual principle. The widow's problem was that she had too few vessels **… She had to borrow empty vessels—this speaks of the need for empty room within us for the Holy Spirit.** She was to borrow not a few—this means the more the better. There should not be only one empty room but many empty rooms. One empty space is not enough; there needs to be many empty spaces. **The more empty spaces there are, the more fullness there will be. This is a principle which the Lord has shown us: spiritual progress is a matter of being continually emptied out and continually filled up** . The work of the Holy Spirit is not "once empty then forever full" but "always empty and always full." Therefore, brothers and sisters, do not think that as long as we have been emptied once, we will not need any more emptying… Brothers and sisters, God is waiting for us to empty ourselves. If there is an infinite emptiness in us, the Holy Spirit will grant us an infinite filling. Whether or not we will receive the blessing of the Holy Spirit depends on whether we have empty vessels. It depends on whether or not we have reserved room for the Holy Spirit and whether or not we have provided Him a place to work in us (_Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 37: General Messages (1),_ Chapter 23, Section 3).

**The only condition for God's blessing, spiritual growth, or the experience of the fullness of the Lord is to be empty** . **We have to constantly realize our own fullness, and we should also constantly empty ourselves of our own fullness.**** We should constantly empty ourselves. Only those who are hungry will be filled with good things **(Luke 1:53). All God's spiritual grace is only for the hungry ones (_Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 11: The Present Testimony (4)_, Chapter 9).

We all need to be emptied of anything other than Christ that occupies us. **Our being needs to be unloaded for the Lord Jesus. We need to empty ourselves** . **According to the Bible, to humble ourselves is to empty ourselves. We need to empty ourselves so that all of the space within us will be available for the growth of the Lord Jesus in us.** To empty ourselves and give the Lord Jesus all the room within us is to enter into the kingdom of God. We should not regard the kingdom as a material realm that we shall enter one day after certain terms have been fulfilled. That is a traditional concept of the kingdom of God, not the teaching concerning the kingdom in the New Testament. **We need to be impressed with the fact that to enter into the kingdom of God is to empty ourselves, to unload ourselves of everything other than Christ so that our entire being may be available for Him to grow in us in full** … We should not be occupied with culture, religion, ethics, morality, philosophy, improvement of character, or the effort to be spiritual, scriptural, holy, and victorious. We should care only for Christ and for the growth of Christ within us. All the ground within us should be made available for Him to grow in us. In [Matthew 13 and Mark 4] we see the Lord Jesus as the Sower coming to sow Himself into us as the soil. He expects that we shall empty ourselves, unload ourselves, and give Him the ground to grow in us (_Life-Study of Mark,_ Chapter 66).

**What is the main purpose of unloading all these things? It is to perfect you in one matter: that Christ will really live in you and that the church will be your practical living of Christ.** So far we haven't reached the goal. We have a long way to go. We have too many things to unload. I don't mean that only the negative ones, the dissenting ones, the worldly ones, the fleshly ones, or the sinful ones need to be unloaded; I mean also the positive ones. I mean _you_ need to be unloaded (_Perfecting Training,_ Chapter 19).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 255** _

1. Lord, breathe Thy Spirit on me,Teach me how to breathe Thee in;Help me pour into Thy bosomAll my life of self and sin.

I am breathing out my sorrow,  
Breathing out my sin;  
I am breathing, breathing, breathing,  
All Thy fulness in.

1. I am breathing out my own life,That I may be filled with Thine;Letting go my strength and weakness,Breathing in Thy life divine.
2. Breathing out my sinful nature,Thou hast borne it all for me;Breathing in Thy cleansing fulness,Finding all my life in Thee.
3. I am breathing out my sorrow,On Thy kind and gentle breast;Breathing in Thy joy and comfort,Breathing in Thy peace and rest.
4. I am breathing out my sickness,Thou hast borne its burden too;I am breathing in Thy healing,Ever promised, ever new.
5. I am breathing out my longingsIn Thy listening, loving ear;I am breathing in Thy answers,Stilling every doubt and fear.
6. I am breathing every moment,Drawing all my life from Thee;Breath by breath I live upon Thee,Lord, Thy Spirit breathe in me.

_ **Hymn 250, ss. 1, 3** _

1Spring up, well, with water;

Dig Thou, Lord, completely;

Dig away all barriers

That Thy stream flow through me.

3I will dig by praying,

Dig the dirt entirely,

Thus release the Spirit,

Let the stream flow freely.
