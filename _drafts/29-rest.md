Sabbath

**Scriptures** :

Gen. 2:2 And on the seventh day God finished His work which He had done, and **He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done** .

Gen. 49:11a **Binding his foal to the vine, / And his donkey's colt to the choice vine** .

Exo. 35:2a Six days shall work be done, **but on the seventh day you shall have a Sabbath of complete rest** …

Jer. 6:16a Thus says Jehovah, / Stand by the ways and see, / And ask for the ancient paths; / Ask where the good way is, and walk in it; **/ And you will find rest for your souls** .

Psa. 23:2 He makes me lie down in green pastures; / **He leads me beside waters of rest** .

S.S. 2:3b - **In his shade I delighted and sat down** , "And his fruit was sweet to my taste."

S.S. 2:7 I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, / By the gazelles or by the hinds of the fields, / **Not to rouse up or awaken my love / Until she pleases** .

Matt. 11:28 **Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest** . 29 Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and **you will find rest for your souls.**

2 Cor. 2:13a **I had no rest in my spirit** , for I did not find Titus my brother.

Heb. 4:3 **For we who have believed enter into the rest** , even as He has said, "As I swore in My wrath, They shall not enter into My rest!" although the works of creation were completed from the foundation of the world.

**Footnotes** :

Gen 2:2, note 1, par. 2 Later, the seventh day was commemorated as the Sabbath (Exo. 20:8-11). **God's seventh day was man's first day. God had prepared everything for man's enjoyment. After man was created, he did not join in God's work; he entered into God's rest. Man was created not to work but to be satisfied with God and rest with God** (cf. Matt. 11:28-30). The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath (Mark 2:27).

Exo 20:8, note 1 See note 231 in ch. 16. The Sabbath signifies that God has done everything, completed everything, and prepared everything and that man must stop all his work. **To keep the Sabbath is to stop our work and to take God and all that He has accomplished for us as our enjoyment, rest, and satisfaction. This is God's economy** . See note 21 in Gen. 2.

Exo 35:2, note 1 This word concerning the keeping of the Sabbath, coming before the commandments concerning the making of the tabernacle with its furniture and the garments for the priests, indicates that **before God's people work for Him, they must rest with Him.** The way of first working for God and then enjoying grace and rest is according to the law. **According to grace, we first enjoy grace and rest with the Lord; then we work for Him** (cf. 1 Cor. 15:10). See note 131 in ch. 31.

Isa 56:2, note 1 **According to this book the real meaning of keeping the Sabbath is that we cease from our doing, stop our work, and enjoy what the Lord has done for us, drinking of Him as the waters (12:3; 55:1). Keeping the Sabbath in this way is to be terminated and replaced by Christ so that we may enter into Him and rest in Him for eternity (Gal. 2:20). The entire Christian life should be such a Sabbath** .

S.S. 2:3, note 1 The lover appreciates Christ as the source of rich provision (apple tree) who supplies her in a timely way. **She is satisfied with her delight in resting (sitting down) under Christ as an overshadowing canopy in the day** (shade—Isa. 4:5-6; 2 Cor. 12:9) and with her tasting Him as the sweet, timely supply (sweet fruit).

S.S. 2:7, note 1 Considering His lover as one who is easily stirred up (gazelles or hinds of the fields), Christ solemnly charges (adjures) the meddling believers (daughters of Jerusalem) **not to awaken His lover from her present experience of Christ in resting in Him. In her Christian life she has reached the goal of resting in and experiencing Christ and being satisfied in the church life. He allows her to remain at rest until she is pleased to enter into the second stage of her pursuing after Him (until she pleases).**

**Ministry Excerpts** :

**Everyone is looking for rest. Rest always includes satisfaction. If we are not satisfied, we can never be at rest** . **Whenever we come to the Lord, the first thing we receive is rest** . (_Life-Study of Genesis_ p. 895)

**In the proper church life...we lie down to rest and enjoy both the finished work of Christ and the riches of Christ….As we rest and enjoy Christ in such a way, we are willing to bow our shoulder to bear a heavy burden to do the taskwork** , the work assigned by our King-Master, so that we may be able to render tribute to our King. (_Life-Study of Genesis_ p.1271)

...All Christians are also journeying, striving, and laboring donkeys. I certainly used to be like this when I was young. I was striving to overcome sin with the goal of one day becoming an overcomer. That was my destination, my goal. I continued my striving until the day I saw the vision of binding my donkey to the vine. I saw that there was no need for me to labor or travel to reach my destination because I had already come to my destination and I had already reached my goal. **Our destination is the vine, the living Christ who is full of life. We must bind our donkey to this vine. This means that we must cease our labor and our striving and rest in Christ, the living One** ….you should tie your donkey to the vine, which is Christ, the source of life, the One who is full of life. Christ is not only the vine, but even the choice vine, the very choice source of life. **We must stop our labor and rest in Him** . (_Life-Study of Genesis _pp. 1282-1284)

**Christ is not only the believers' peace and joy but also their rest. In Matthew 11:28 the Lord Jesus called people, saying, "Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest."** The toil spoken of in this verse refers not only to the toil of striving to keep the commandments of the law and religious regulations but also to the toil of struggling to be successful in any work. Whoever toils thus is always heavily burdened. The Lord called such toiling ones to come to Him for rest. **Rest refers not only to being set free from the toil and burden under the law and religion or under any work or responsibility, but also to perfect peace and full satisfaction** (_Truth Lessons_, _Level 2, Vol. 3_, Chapter 8).

**Rest includes the thought of relief, peace, and ease….We need to take care of the inner relief, peace, and ease within our spirit** . **This is one basic, spiritual principle in the matter of life. If we are going to grow in life, we should not care for the outward circumstances. We have to take care of the inner feeling of whether or not we have the rest deep within us** ….The Lord might say to us, "My child, I know that your circumstances and reasons are good, but do you have the rest with the Lord? **Do you care for the outward circumstances or the inward rest** ? I am not in the outward circumstances. I am in your spirit."….To follow the rest you have to pay a price. To argue may give you a certain kind of pleasure, but you lose the Lord's presence; you do not have the rest with the Lord. I am not speaking of the rest in your thinking or of the satisfaction in your emotion **. I am speaking of the real ease, relief, peace, and rest in your spirit. We all have to learn this deeper lesson. I encourage you all to follow the Lord in this way. This is the way to grow in life. Never care for the outward circumstances; always care for the inner res** t (_The Experience of Christ as Life for the Building Up of the Church_, Chapter 13).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 579, ss. 1, 3-4** _

1Jesus! I am resting, resting

In the joy of what Thou art;

I am finding out the greatness

Of Thy loving heart.

Thou hast bid me gaze upon Thee,

And Thy beauty fills my soul,

For, by Thy transforming power,

Thou hast made me whole.

Jesus! I am resting, resting

In the joy of what Thou art;

I am finding out the greatness

Of Thy loving heart.

3Simply trusting Thee, Lord Jesus,

I behold Thee as Thou art,

And Thy love, so pure, so changeless,

Satisfies my heart,

Satisfies its deepest longings,

Meets, supplies its every need,

Compasseth me round with blessings,

Thine is love indeed.

4Ever lift Thy face upon me,

As I work and wait for Thee;

Resting 'neath Thy smile, Lord Jesus,

Earth's dark shadows flee.

Brightness of my Father's glory,

Sunshine of my Father's face,

Keep me ever trusting, resting,

Fill me with Thy grace.

_ **Hymn 580, ss. 1, 4-5** _

1Resting on the faithfulness of Christ our Lord,

Resting on the fulness of His own sure word,

Resting on His wisdom, on His love and pow'r,

Resting on His covenant from hour to hour.

4Resting in the pastures and beneath the Rock,

Resting by the waters where He leads His flock,

Resting, while we listen, at His glorious feet,

Resting in His very arms, oh, rest complete!

5Resting and believing, let us onward press;

Resting on Himself, the Lord our righteousness;

Resting and rejoicing, let His saved ones sing,

Glory, glory, glory be to Christ our King!

29 - Rest
