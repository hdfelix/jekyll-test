**Scriptures** :

Psa. 100:4 **Enter His gates with thanksgiving** , / His courts with praise; / Give thanks to Him; bless His name.

Psa. 118:19 Open to me the gates of righteousness: **/ I will enter in through them; I will give thanks to Jehovah** .

Neh. 9:15 And You gave them bread from heaven / For their hunger, / And You made water come forth from a rock for them / For their thirst. / **And You told them to enter / In order to possess the land** , / Which You swore / To give them.

Matt. 18:3 And said, Truly I say to you, **Unless you turn and become like little children, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.**

John 10:9 - I am the door; **if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved** and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture.

Heb. 10:19 **Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus** , 20 Which entrance He initiated for us as a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh,

Rev. 22:14 **Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter by the gates into the city.**

**Footnotes** :

John 10:9, note 2 The pasture here signifies Christ as the feeding place for the sheep. When the pasture is not available (e.g., in the wintertime or at night), the sheep must be kept in the fold. When the pasture is ready, there is no further need for the sheep to remain in the fold. To be kept in the fold is transitional and temporary. To be in the pasture enjoying its riches is final and permanent. Before Christ came, the law was a ward, and being under the law was transitional. **Now that Christ has come, all God's chosen people must come out of the law and come into Him to enjoy Him as their pasture** (Gal. 3:23-25; 4:3-5). This should be final and permanent. Because they did not have such a revelation, the leaders in Judaism considered the law, on which Judaism was based, as permanent. As a result, they missed Christ and could not participate in Him as their pasture.

Heb 6:19, note 2 The heavens, into which **the Lord Jesus entered** , are today the Holy of Holies within the veil. Our hope, as a secure and firm anchor, has entered there, and **we may now enter there in our spirit (10:19-20).**

Heb 10:19, note 1 The Holy of Holies today is in heaven, where the Lord Jesus is (9:12, 24). **How, then, can we enter the Holy of Holies while we are still on earth? The secret is our spirit, referred to in 4:12** . The very Christ who is in heaven is now also in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). As the heavenly ladder (Gen. 28:12; John 1:51), He joins our spirit to heaven and brings heaven into our spirit. Hence, **whenever we turn to our spirit, we enter into the Holy of Holies** . There we meet with God, who is on the throne of grace. See note 161 in ch. 4.

**Ministry Excerpts** :

After showing us the heavenly Christ within the veil, the book of Hebrews encourages us to enter within the veil (10: 19-20, 22). Within the veil, we can look away unto Him (12:2) and can consider Him (12:3; 3:1). We need to have direct contact with Him. **Since He is within the veil, we also must enter within the veil that we may see Him, look at Him, and consider Him in order to receive the transfusion and infusion of Him** . **Of course, we can only do this by exercising our spirit.** As we have seen, our spirit is joined to the heavenly Holy of Holies. When we turn to our spirit and exercise it, we enter within the veil. Here we participate in the heavenly ministry of the heavenly Christ. Here we are saturated and permeated with all the divine riches that make us the corporate reproduction of the Firstborn Son of God for His expression. Here we receive grace and are strengthened to go outside the camp and follow Him on the pathway of the cross. (_Life-study of Hebrews_, p. 633)

**If we would enter within the veil, we must get into our spirit** (4:l2). To be within the veil is to be in our spirit, and to be outside the camp is to he outside anything religious. We must not remain in any camp, but get into our spirit. If you remain in the religious camp. you are still camping outside your spirit. But we are no longer camping — we are in the Holy of Holies. The writer seemed to be telling the Hebrew believers, Brothers, get out of your camping mind and get into your spirit. **Today we also must exercise to bring our whole being into the spirit** . We must not remain in our camping mentality, for that mentality is religious. Again and again we need to enter within the veil by entering into our spirit.

it is difficult for Christian readers to understand why the writer of Hebrews mentions the spirit in 4:12. As he is comparing Christ with Judaism, he suddenly says, 'The word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit." Now we understand that this verse shows us the key to experiencing Christ — our spirit which is joined to the Holy of Holies. Therefore, we must discern our spirit from our camping mentality, from our camping soul. We must no longer camp in our mind but turn to our spirit. The Lord Jesus Christ is with our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). Grace is with our spirit (Gal. 6:18 **). We have seen that we must take grace, but where do we go to take grace? We must go to our spirit.** The Holy of Holies, God's economy, and even the fulfillment of God's economy are all related to our spirit. What we need today is to enter within the veil by getting into the spirit. (_Life-study of Hebrews_, p. 637)

**We are for just one thing — the dispensation of the Triune God into our being that we might be transformed and built together as His corporate expression and that we might terminate this age and usher in the kingdom. This can only be accomplished by our entering within the veil to experience the ark of God's testimony with the hidden manna, the budding rod, and the law of life.** By experiencing these things, we are infused, empowered, strengthened, and enabled to go outside of every camp. **My real burden in all these messages on Hebrews is that we may all enter within the veil and go outside the camp. This is the goal and the ultimate conclusion of this book.**

**When we enter within the veil by getting into our spirit, we taste the sweetness of the heavenly Christ that we may be enabled to go outside the camp, forsaking the earth and its love.** As we stay within the veil, we also have our spirit filled with the glory of the heavenly Christ that our heart may be freed from the possession of the earth's enjoyment outside the camp. Furthermore, within the veil we behold the glorified Christ that we may be attracted to follow the suffering Jesus outside the camp. Beholding His countenance in heaven enables us to trace His footsteps on earth. **As we enter within the veil, we are infused with resurrection power (Phil. 3:10) that we may be empowered to walk the pathway of the cross outside the camp** . (_Life-study of Hebrews_, p. 639)

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 549** _

1Enter the veil and go without the camp,

Taste heaven's sweetness, thus the earth forsake;

If by the Holiest I am satisfied,

How can I of earth's vanities partake?

2Enter the veil and go without the camp,

By heaven's presence will the earth depart;

If heaven's glory doth my spirit charm,

How can earth's happiness possess my heart?

3Enter the veil, behold the glorious Christ,

Go out the camp to Jesus, let Him lead;

If throne and crown my spirit here enthrall,

Manger and cross cannot my steps impede.

4Enter the veil for resurrection pow'r,

Go out the camp to bear the cross and woe,

If I His radiant face in heaven see,

His footsteps I will follow here below.

5Enter the veil, on heaven's fatness feast,

Without the camp, in hardship persevere;

Though earthly trials sorely pain my heart,

Heaven's communion doth my spirit cheer.

6Enter the veil, Christ's riches there enjoy,

Without the camp, the needs of men supply;

The life of heaven living out thru me

The souls of earth will bless and satisfy.

7Enter the veil till it exists no more,

Go out the camp till all the camps are gone;

Until the heavens and the earth unite,

Till God and man together dwell in one.

_ **I Will Enter His Gates** _

I will enter His gates with thanksgiving in my heart;

I will enter His courts with praise.

I will say this is the day that the Lord has made.

I will rejoice for He has made me glad.

He has made me glad, He has made me glad,

I will rejoice for He has made me glad.

He has made me glad, He has made me glad,

I will rejoice for He has made me glad.

21 - Enter
