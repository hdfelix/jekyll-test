**Scriptures** :

Psa. 34:1 I will bless Jehovah at all times; / **His praise will continually be in my mouth** .

Psa. 69:30 **I will praise the name of God with a song** / And will magnify Him with thanksgiving;

Psa. 86:12 **I will praise You, O Lord my God, with all my heart** ; / And I will glorify Your name forever.

Psa. 119:164 **Seven times a day I praise You** / For Your righteous ordinances.

Psa. 146:2 **I will praise Jehovah while I live;** / I will sing psalms to my God while I yet have being.

Psa. 150:6 **Let everything that has breath praise Jehovah** . / Hallelujah!

Matt. 21:16 And they said to Him, Do you hear what these are saying? And Jesus said to them, Yes. Have you never read, " **Out of the mouth of infants and sucklings You have perfected praise"** ?

Acts 16:25 And about midnight Paul and Silas, **while praying, sang hymns of praise to God** ; and the prisoners were listening to them.

Heb. 13:15 **Through Him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise continually to God** , that is, the fruit of lips confessing His name.

**Footnotes:**

Psa 8:22 The Septuagint translates, perfected praise (cf. Matt. 21:16).

Heb. 13:151 Verse 15 is a continuation of vv. 8-14. Since in the church life we enjoy the unchanging Christ as grace and follow Him outside religion, we should offer through Him spiritual sacrifices to God. **First, in the church we should offer up through Him a sacrifice of praise to God continually. In the church He sings in us hymns of praise unto God the Father (2:12). In the church we too should praise God the Father through Him. Eventually, in the church He and we, we and He, praise the Father together in the mingled spirit.** He, as the life-giving Spirit, praises the Father in our spirit, and we, by our spirit, praise the Father in His Spirit. This is the best and highest sacrifice that we can offer to God through Him. This is greatly needed in the church meetings.

**Ministry Excerpts** :

**David said in a psalm that he prayed to God three times a day (Psa. 55:17). Yet in another psalm, he said that he praised God seven times a day (119:164)** . **David was inspired by the Holy Spirit when he acknowledged the importance of praising. He prayed only three times a day, but he praised seven times a day** . Furthermore, he appointed Levites to play psalteries and harps to exalt, thank, and praise God before the ark of His covenant (1 Chron. 16:4-6). When Solomon completed the building of Jehovah's temple, the priests carried the ark of the covenant into the Holy of Holies. When the priests came out of the Holy Place, the Levites stood beside the altar, sounded the trumpets, and sang with cymbals, psalteries, and harps. Together they sounded praises to God. At that moment, the glory of Jehovah filled His house (2 Chron. 5:12-14). Both David and Solomon touched God's heart and offered up sacrifices of praise that were pleasing to God. **Jehovah is enthroned upon the praises of Israel. We should praise the Lord all our life. We should sing praises to our God** . (Watchman Nee, _Praising_, Chapter 1)

**Whenever you run out of strength to pray and you find your spirit heavily oppressed, wounded, or sagging, praise Him. If you cannot pray, try to praise** . We invariably think that we should pray when the burden is heavy and praise when the burden is over. But please bear in mind that there are times when the burden is so heavy that you cannot pray. That is the time for you to praise. We do not praise when there is no burden; we praise when the burden becomes too heavy. When you encounter unusual circumstances and problems and are bewildered and feel like collapsing, just remember one thing, "Why not praise?" Here is a golden opportunity. If you offer your praise at that moment, God's Spirit will operate in you, open all the doors, and break all the chains. (Watchman Nee, _Praising_, Chapter 1)

Psalm 8:2 says that the Lord has established strength out of the mouths of babes and sucklings. Seemingly, strength does not refer to something that comes out of the mouth. When the Lord quoted this verse in Matthew 21:16, He used the word praise instead of strength. Weaker ones in themselves cannot praise. To cry or weep does not require strength, but to praise requires strength. When we gossip, argue, or reason with people, that does not require strength. But without strength, we cannot praise the Lord. Some praises may come out of our mouth, but they cannot be considered as perfected praises, because they are not so full of strength. **Praises should be full of strength. Many times when the saints are praising the Lord, we can see the strength.** (_Life-Study of Psalms_, Chapter 5)

The happiest persons are not always the ones who have the loudest praise. **The loudest praise comes very often from the ones who are passing through hardships. This kind of praise is most pleasing to God and is blessed by Him.** God does not want men to praise Him only when they are on the mountaintop surveying Canaan, the promised land. **God desires much more to see His people writing psalms and praising Him when they "walk through the valley of the shadow of death" (23:4). This is genuine praise** . (_Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 48: Messages for Building Up New Believers (1),_ Chapter 17, Section 2)

A number of the sisters among us are still in their early twenties, but their fatigued attitude makes them seem like they are over one hundred years old. With them there is no freshness and no strength. With them nothing is in the morning; instead, everything is in the sunset. **They need to learn to praise the Lord. The weakest among men being perfected to praise the Lord indicates the highest consummation of the Lord's work in His redemption.** (_Life-Study of Psalms,_ Chapter 5, Section 5)

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 124** _

1Praise Him! praise Him! Christ is Victor!

He has won the victory!

Sin is judged, old Adam finished,

Full redemption now we see!

Vanquished all the evil powers

Thru the Cross triumphantly!

2Praise Him! Christ is resurrected!

God hath raised Him from the dead!

All the pow'r of death is swallowed,

Man from death to life is led!

Broken through are hell and darkness

And His pow'r exhibited!

3Praise Him' Christ hath now ascended!

God hath raised Him to the throne!

Far above all rule and power,

He the highest Name doth own!

All authority receiving

Till His foe is overthrown!

4Hallelujah, Christ the Victor

Triumphed on Mt. Calvary!

Hallelujah, resurrected,

He displays His victory!

Hallelujah, now ascended,

He shall reign eternally!

_ **Hymn 308** _

1. Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine;Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine!Heir of salvation, purchase of God,Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.

This is my story, this is my song,  
Praising my Savior all the day long.  
This is my story, this is my song,  
Praising my Savior all the day long.

1. Perfect submission, perfect delight,Visions of rapture now burst on my sight;Angels descending, bring from aboveEchoes of mercy, whispers of love.

1. Perfect submission, all is at rest,I in my Savior am happy and blest;Watching and waiting, looking above,Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.
