**Dictionary definition** : reliance on [the](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/the)integrity, strength, ability, surety, of a person or thing; confidence.

**Scriptures** :

Prov. 3:5 **Trust in Jehovah with all your heart,** / And do not rely on your own understanding;

Psa. 9:10 And **those who know Your name put their trust in You,** / For You have not forsaken those who seek You, O Jehovah.

Psa. 31:14 **But I trust in You, O Jehovah** ; / I say, You are my God.

Psa. 37:3 **Trust in Jehovah,** and do good; / Dwell in the land, and feed on His faithfulness.

Isa. 26:4 **Trust in Jehovah forever and ever** , / For in Jah Jehovah we have an eternal rock.

2 Cor. 1:9 Indeed we ourselves had the response of death in ourselves, that **we should not base our confidence on ourselves but on God** , who raises the dead;

Phil. 3:3 For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and **have no confidence in the flesh** .

**Footnotes** :

1 Sam. 30:81 **David was a person who trusted in God and walked according to God's sovereignty in all his trials** (17:36-37; 23:14-16). While he was under trial, he sought God's leading (vv. 6b-10). He was one with God and behaved according to God.

Psa. 51:51 To confess, as David did here, that we were born in sin indicates that we have no trust in ourselves (cf. Rom. 7:18; Phil. 3:3). **Realizing that we are sinful and God is holy, we trust only in Him** . Also, we realize that we need Christ to be our Mediator and our sacrifice (see note 71).

**Ministry Excerpts** :

We may say, "I do not trust in myself. I trust in the Lord." To say this is easy. We do not know how much we cheat ourselves in saying this. It is not easy to lose our trust in ourselves. Every one among us is a self-trusting one. It is really hard for us to get rid of self-trust. Even little children have self-trust. They may love their mother very much, but they do not trust in their mother; they trust in themselves. The more a child grows, the more that child trusts in himself. A mother realizes that after a child becomes five years of age he no longer trusts in her. The more one grows, the more he trusts in himself. For every full-grown man there is the full-grown trust in the self. We may have no trust in others and no trust in the Lord. **Our trust is only in ourselves. To learn the lesson not to trust in ourselves but in the Lord is not easy because of our cleverness, wisdom, natural strength, and natural motive. We need many years to be rid of our natural cleverness, natural wisdom, natural strength, and natural motive** (_Enjoying the Riches of Christ for the Building Up of the Church as the Body of Christ,_ Chapter 10).

In 2 Corinthians 1, Paul told us that he and his co-workers were "excessively burdened, beyond our power, so that we despaired even of living" (v. 8). **They had the sentence of death in themselves that they should not trust in themselves but in the very God who raises the dead** (v. 9). We need to be impressed with these words in 1:9—"we should not have confidence in ourselves, but in God." Through the redemption of Christ, the very God, who is in the heavens, has come into us, into our spirit (Col. 1:27; 2 Tim. 4:22). **Thank the Lord that He is now in our spirit, calling us to forget about the soulish things and turn to our spirit to meet Him. We should no longer trust in our self, in our soul, but in God who is in our spirit**

We may know the doctrine concerning no longer trusting in ourselves but in God. To say that we trust in God is easy, but in our experience it may be different. If a husband's wife is not so nice to him, the first thing he usually does is to exercise his mind to consider his wife's situation. This is what it means to trust in yourself. **If we have really learned the lesson to trust no more in ourselves, we would not exercise our mind first but our spirit. Immediately, we should turn to our spirit and exercise our spirit to contact God. This practically means that we do not trust in ourselves but in God. We all need this kind of experience today** (_Autobiography of a Person in the Spirit, An,_ Chapter 2).

As an ambassador of Christ, Paul realized that whatever was within him, whatever he was, and whatever he had was mortal (5:4). Anything that is subject to death is mortal. Our wisdom is mortal, and our ability is mortal. **Whatever we can do, whatever we are, and whatever we have is going to die. This is why we should not have any trust in what we are** . We have to realize that we are mortal beings, but God has wrought into us something which is eternal, something which will never die, something which will last forever. Because we have received the Lord Jesus and He lives in us, we possess His immortal divinity. Eventually all that we are that is mortal will be "swallowed up by life" (5:4). Mortality will be swallowed up by the divine life….We have to be clear that we are mortals, that whatever we can do, whatever we are, and whatever we have will die. We should not have any trust in ourselves nor should we live by ourselves. We need to realize that someone else is within us. This Person is the immortal life, the divine life (John 14:6). We should trust in this life, live by this life, and behave ourselves by this life. This life qualifies us and equips us to be the ambassadors of Christ. A person is not qualified to be an ambassador of Christ by power, by gift, or by knowledge, but by the immortal life within him. **We need to forget about ourselves, to give up whatever we can do and whatever we are, and put our trust in this immortal life which is God Himself in Christ** (_Autobiography of a Person in the Spirit, An,_ Chapter 6).

When we reject ourselves in this way, only Christ is left. Then whatever we do will be the experience of Christ. When the unbelievers reject themselves and repudiate their flesh, nothing remains. But when we reject ourselves, we enjoy Christ as the remainder. Christ is what remains after we have rejected our flesh and all we are by nature. This is not merely a doctrine; it is our experience (_The Experience of Christ,_ Chapter 6).

_ **Hymn 578** _

1My will is weak, my strength is frail,

And all my hope is nearly gone;

I can but trust Thy working true

To gently hold and lead me on.

2I've tried my best, but still have failed,

E'en as before I've failed and erred;

Thy patience is my only trust

To hold and keep me to Thy word.

3Whene'er my heart is lifted up,

How very near I am to fall;

I dare not do, I dare not think,

I need Thyself in great or small.

4Thou art my Savior, strength and stay,

O Lord, I come to seek Thy face;

Though I'm the weakest of the weak,

My strength is nothing but Thy grace.
