**Scriptures** :

S. S. 5:2 I sleep, but my heart is awake. / A sound! My beloved is knocking. / **Open to me, my sister, my love** , / My dove, my perfect one; / For my head is drenched with dew, / My locks with the drops of night. 5 **I rose up to open to my beloved;** / And my hands dripped with myrrh, / My fingers with liquid myrrh, / Upon the handles of the bolt.

Ezek. 2:8 But you, son of man, hear what I say to you; do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. **Open your mouth and eat what I give you** . 3:2 So **I opened my mouth, and He gave me that scroll to eat** .

Acts 16:14 And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple-dyed goods from the city of Thyatira who worshipped God, was listening, **whose heart the Lord opened to give heed to the things being spoken by Paul** .

Rev. 3:20 Behold, I stand at the door and knock; **if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, then I will come in to him** and dine with him and he with Me.

**Footnotes** :

Gen 2:15, note 2 Man's working the ground was that life, especially the tree of life (v. 9), might grow for the fulfillment of the first aspect of God's purpose, i.e., to express God in His image. The ground typifies the human heart, into which Christ as the seed of the tree of life is sown (Matt. 13:3-23). **To work the ground signifies to loosen and break our hard heart, to open our heart to the heavens that the Spirit as the rain** (see note 51) **may descend for the growth of Christ as the tree of life within us.**

Gen 37:36, note 1 The time from the selling of Joseph to the sending of Jacob's sons to Egypt (42:1-5) was at least twenty years. In the record of Jacob those twenty years were a time of silence. **Through the loss of Joseph, Jacob became a person who was absolutely open to God. It must have been that during those years God dispensed Himself into Jacob more and more, until Jacob was filled with the divine life unto maturity** . See note 21 in ch. 42.

Exo 21:6, note 2 A slave should stand in the position of doing nothing on his own but acting only according to the word of his master and **should have his ear open to hear the voice of his master** (John 5:30; Psa. 40:6; Isa. 50:4-5).

S.S. 5:5, note 1 **The lover's action in opening to Christ shows Him her appreciation of His sweet death (myrrh)** .

S.S. 7:4, note 1 Here the Spirit reviews her beauty in her submissive will (neck) wrought by the Spirit's transforming work through sufferings for the carrying out of God's will, **in the expression of her heart, which is open to the light, clean, full of rest, and accessible (eyes like pools** —cf. 1:15; 4:1; 5:12), and in her spiritual sense of high and sharp discernment (nose—cf. Phil. 1:9-10; Heb. 5:14).

Gal 3:5, note 1 The Greek word means supplies fully, bountifully, and liberally. See Phil. 1:19. On God's side, He supplies the Spirit bountifully; on our side, we receive the Spirit. Day by day a marvelous divine transmission takes place: God supplies and we receive. **The way to open ourselves to this heavenly transmission to receive the supply of the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is to exercise our spirit to pray and call on the Lord** .

Eph 1:18, note 1, par. 2 To have the eyes of our heart enlightened requires that our conscience, mind, emotion, and will, which are the components of our heart, be thoroughly dealt with (cf. note 171 in ch. 3). **First, we need an open spirit with a conscience purified by our confessing and dealing with our sins and by the sprinkling of the redeeming blood of Christ** (Heb. 9:14; 10:22). Next, we need a sober mind (2 Tim. 1:7 and note 2), a loving emotion (John 14:21), and a submissive will (John 7:17) in order to have a pure heart. When we have such a spirit and heart, the eyes of our heart will be able to see.

Col 4:3, note 1 This implies that **we need to keep ourselves open to the word of God** .

**Ministry Excerpts** :

**If you want to fan your spirit into flame, you need to open up your mouth, open up your heart, and open up your spirit. You need to open these three layers of your being.** You have to use your mouth to say, "O Lord Jesus." But then you have to go deeper by using your mouth with your heart to say, "O Lord Jesus." Then you need to go even deeper by using your mouth with your heart and with your spirit to say, "O Lord Jesus." This is to open up your spirit from deep within. Then the fire burns. If you are down, you should call, "O Lord Jesus" again and again from deep within with the exercise of your spirit. Then you will be up (_The Spirit with our Spirit_, Chapter 8).

In the spiritual realm, the mind with all the thoughts is the lens, and a right spirit in a right heart is the film within. **You need to have an open mind with a right spirit in a right heart. Then you need the shutter, which means you need to open yourself to the Lord. The divine light is waiting for this. When you open yourself to the Lord, when your mind with the thoughts is open, and you have a right spirit in a right heart, the divine light brings Christ into your spirit and impresses Christ into your spirit** . Now within you there is a picture, an image, and this image is the very treasure contained in these earthen vessels. **Our mind with our thoughts needs to be so open** , and our heart needs to be right with a pure and proper spirit. **Day and night we need to open ourselves to the Lord; then Christ** , the heavenly, divine scenery, will be impressed into you again and again. Do not say that you have already been saved and that Christ is in you already. Christ is in you, in your spirit, but He is not in your heart so much. **You need again and again to have an open mind with all your thoughts regulated by Him, and you need a proper heart with a pure and open spirit** . All day long you need to use the shutter, which means you need to open yourself to the Lord. Then Christ as the heavenly treasure will be impressed into you (_Life-Study of Romans,_ Chapter 6).

**God only wants us to love Him and to keep ourselves open to Him. "Lord, I love You. I fully realize that I am just an empty vessel…Have mercy upon me that I may keep myself open to You all the time." We all have to confess that many times in our prayer we are not open to Him.** Even in our prayer we still keep ourselves closed. Since the day we were saved, we never opened ourselves in an absolute way. **We always opened ourselves with some amount of reservation** . Even you yourself probably do not realize that the reservation is there. It is hidden. **You think that you are open to the Lord. Actually, you are not entirely open. You are open, but only partially. You are open superficially and in a shallow way. In the depths of your being you are not open, so the Lord cannot do anything** . If you look into [Paul's Epistles] you may say that the summary of these fourteen Epistles may be expressed in just two words: **open vessel. God wants an open vessel. What is the meaning of an open vessel? An open vessel is doing nothing but keeping itself open to the filling up** . The processed God—the Triune God, the all-inclusive Spirit, the compound Spirit—is here waiting for an opening to get into you. How much He would enter into you depends upon how much opening you would give Him. It is really hard to have a person on the one hand absolutely open to the Lord and on the other hand, doing nothing. If you can love the Lord and yet do nothing, that would be a miracle. When you love someone, surely you want to do something for him. But the Bible logic says love the Lord, but don't do anything for Him by yourself. Love the Lord to the uttermost; don't do anything for Him by yourself. You have to be active-passive. To love the Lord to the uttermost is to be active. Not to do anything is to be passive. **What the Lord wants is that we love Him, that we keep ourselves open** . Don't do anything. Let Him in. (_Perfecting Training_, Chapter 22)

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 784, s 2 & Chorus** _

Pray to fellowship with Jesus,

Fully opened from within,

With thy face unveiled, beholding,

Single, pure, and genuine.

Pray to fellowship with Jesus,

In the spirit seek His face;

Ask and listen in His presence,

Waiting in the secret place.

_ **Hymn 1134, ss. 1, 4** _

1Oh, strengthen my spirit, Lord Jesus,

Oh, strengthen my spirit, I pray;

Oh, strengthen my spirit with power

And spread to my heart today.

Into my heart, into my heart,

Spread into my heart, Lord Jesus;

Make home today and have Your way

In all of my heart, Lord Jesus.

4To Him who is able to do it

Above all we think or say,

We open our hearts wide and welcome

Him into our heart today.

_ **Hymn 807** _

1Open my eyes that I may see

Glimpses of truth Thou hast for me;

Place in my hands the wonderful key

That shall unclasp and set me free.

Silently now I wait for Thee,

Ready, my God, Thy will to see;

Open my eyes, illumine me,

Spirit Divine!

2 Open my ears that I may hear

Voices of truth Thou sendest clear;

And while the wave notes fall on my ear,

Everything false will disappear.

3Open my mouth and let me bear

Tidings of mercy everywhere;

Open my heart and let me prepare

Love with Thy children thus to share.

4Open my mind that I may read

More of Thy love in word and deed;

What shall I fear while yet Thou dost lead?

Only for light from Thee I plead.

24 - Open
