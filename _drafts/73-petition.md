supplicate, beseech

**Scriptures** :

Psa. 6:9 **Jehovah has heard my supplication** ; / Jehovah receives my prayer.

Dan. 6:11 Then these men assembled and **found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God** .

Dan. 9:20 And while I was still speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and **presenting my supplication before Jehovah my God** for the holy mountain of my God,

Acts 4:31 **And when they had so besought, the place in which they were gathered was shaken** , and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with boldness.

Rom. 10:1 Brothers, the good pleasure of my heart and **my petition to God for them is for their salvation** .

Eph. 6:18 **By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit** and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints,

Phil. 1:4 **Always in my every petition on behalf of you all, making my petition with joy,**

1 Tim. 2:1 **I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men.**

**Footnotes** :

Eph. 6:182Prayer is general and **petition is particular** ; both are needed that we might have a proper, overcoming church life.

Eph. 6:186 (petition) This indicates that **we need to pray in a particular way for all the saints** .

Phil. 4:62 Prayer is general, having worship and fellowship as its essence; **petition is special, being for particular needs** .

**Ministry Excerpts** :

In [Philippians] 4:6 and 7 Paul says, "In nothing be anxious, but **in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God** ; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus." Paul certainly composed these verses in a very thoughtful way. In verse 6 he speaks of prayer, petition, and thanksgiving. Prayer is general and includes the essence of worship and fellowship; **petition is special and is related to particular needs** . According to Christian experience, to pray is to have fellowship, communion, with the Lord and to worship Him. Daily we need to have a time to contact the Lord, to have fellowship with Him, and to worship Him. **During the course of our fellowship, we may have particular requests. Thus, we not only pray in a general way, but make petitions to the Lord in a particular way. We offer our petitions to the One with whom we are having fellowship. Petition, therefore, is a special request made during the course of our prayer.** (_Life-study of Philippians,_ Chapter 62)

In [Luke 11] verses 9 and 10 the Lord continues, "And I say to you, Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it shall be opened." In these verses we have asking, seeking, and knocking. **To ask is to pray in a common way, to seek is to supplicate in a specific way, and to knock is to reach the door in the closest way** . (_Life-Study of Luke,_ Chapter 27)

According to the Lord's word in Matthew 26, we are all sleepy persons. If you don't sleep physically, you sleep spiritually. And many times you sleep psychologically. While I am speaking some may be sleeping physically while others are sleeping psychologically. This means their mind and their attention and their hearing and their realization are absent. Sometimes you are sleeping spiritually. This means your perception is dormant. **To be a person who prays unceasingly you must be a watchful person, a person fully awakened, fighting against your sleeping nature and your sleeping being. How do you fight? By petitioning. Prayer is a general thing; petition is a special, particular thing. You have to watch unto the general prayer by special petition.** (_Perfecting Training_, Chapter 14)

We know that at every time we have to be watchful because there are dangers ahead. Every time we have to be on guard because there are enemies before us. If there were no danger or enemies, there would be no need to be watchful. In other words, there is the need to be watchful because there are dangers and enemies ahead of us. **Therefore, when we pray and make petitions, we have to be watchful and struggle to find the time. If we want to wait until we have the time to pray, we will never have the opportunity to do so. All those who want to participate in the work of supplication and who want to advance in their prayer life have to make time; they have to set aside a time to pray.** We have to guard this time and strive to lay hold of it. This means that we have to pray that God will give us the time to pray. **We have to have prayers that guard our prayer time. We have to pray that we will not lose these times** . Once these times are lost, there will be no prayer. Every person who wants to properly serve the Lord has to remember and realize that they have to set aside a prayer time. Andrew Murray said that those who have never set aside a time for prayer have never prayed. If we have never scheduled a time to pray, we will never have the time to pray. Furthermore, even if we schedule a time, we have to pray to guard this time and put a camp around this time with prayer, so that it will not be taken away by the enemy. This is what it means to be watching "unto this." The first thing we have to be watchful about is the time of prayer. (_Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 11: The Present Testimony (4),_ Chapter 4)

Daniel's prayer reached the highest peak. He asked God to do something for Himself. He prayed, "Cause Your face to shine upon Your sanctuary that has been desolated, for the Lord's sake" (Dan. 9:17). I hope that we would circle the words "for the Lord's sake." We can see that his prayer was totally for God and not for himself. It seems as if he was saying to God, **"My supplication here today is not for myself but for You. Even though I am asking You to do something, it is not for myself, but for You."** This was a very special prayer; it was also the highest prayer. Our prayers are ninety-nine and nine tenths percent for ourselves. Very few of them are for God. Only a person like Daniel, who prayed to God single-heartedly, can be used by Him to turn the age. (_Men Who Turn the Age_, Chapter 2)

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 776** _

1."Ask in faith," the Name of Jesus

All your plea before the throne;

As you trust, the Lord will whisper,

"See, my child, the work is done."

2."Ask in faith," God waits to answer

Each petition, Spirit-wrought;

He will work in wondrous power,

Far beyond your highest thought.

3."Ask in faith," 'tis just the asking,

In a faith that dares to stand,

Full of joyful expectation,

With an open, outstretched hand.

4."Ask in faith," for God is waiting

For thy faith-filled, earnest prayer.

Faith delights Him; faith can touch Him,

Every moment, everywhere.

_ **Hymn 790, ss. 1, 3** _

1. "Keep the incense burning"

On the altar fire;

Let thy heart's petition,

Let thy deep desire,

Be a cloud of incense

Wreathing God's own throne,

Till His will among us

Shall be fully done.

1. "Keep the incense burning"

On the altar fire;

Feed the flame, Lord Jesus,

Till Thy whole desire

Shall in us, Thy children,

Find free course, and be

Breathed through lips anointed

For this ministry.

1. "Keep the incense burning"

Though thy faith be weak;

Though in words thou canst not

All thy longing speak;

Silent heart-petitions,

Spirit-taught, will be

Gloriously answered;

Wrought by God for thee.

1. "Keep the incense burning,"

Hourly let it rise,

Till from opened heavens,

Till from flame-swept skies,

Fire shall fall and kindle

All hearts to a flame;

Making us a glory

To our Savior's name.

_ **Hymn 846, ss. 1-2** _

1Oh, may my spirit flow,

Oh, may it flow!

Now I beseech Thee, Lord

Oh, may it flow!

My past I would forsake,

The iron walls would break,

My spirit free would make;

Oh, may it flow!

2 Oh, may my spirit flow,

Oh, may it flow!

Now I implore Thee, Lord,

Oh, may it flow!

No more self-satisfied,

No more in self-bound pride,

No more my spirit tied;

Oh, may it flow!
