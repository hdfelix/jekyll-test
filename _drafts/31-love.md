**Scriptures** :

Exo 20:6 Yet **showing lovingkindness to thousands of generations of those who love Me** and keep My commandments.

Mark 12:30 And **you shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and from your whole soul and from your whole mind and from your whole strength** ."

John 14:23 Jesus answered and said to him, **If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.**

1 Cor. 2:9 But as it is written, "Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard and which have not come up in man's heart; **things which God has prepared for those who love Him** ."

Eph. 6:24 **Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibility** .

1 John 4:19 **We love because He first loved us** .

**Footnotes:**

Exo 20:6, note 2, note 1 **…In order for God and His people to be one, there must be a mutual love between them (John 14:21, 23).** The love between God and His people unfolded in the Bible is primarily like the affectionate love between a man and a woman (Jer. 2:2; 31:3). **As God's people love God and spend time to**** fellowship with Him in His word, God infuses them with His divine element, making them one with Him as His spouse, the same as He is in life, nature, and expression **(Gen. 2:18-25 and notes). See note 81, pars. 2 and 3, in ch. 19.

The entire Bible is a divine romance, a record of how God courts His chosen people and eventually marries them (Gen. 2:21-24; S.S. 1:2-4; Isa. 54:5; 62:5; Jer. 2:2; 3:1, 14; 31:32; Ezek. 16:8; 23:5; Hosea 2:7, 19; Matt. 9:15; John 3:29; 2 Cor. 11:2; Eph. 5:25-32; Rev. 19:7; 21:2, 9-10; 22:17). **When we as God's people enter into a love relationship with God, we receive His life, just as Eve received the life of Adam (Gen. 2:21-22). It is this life that enables us to become one with God and makes Him one with us.** We keep the law not by exercising our mind and will (cf. Rom. 7:18-25) but by loving the Lord as our Husband and thereby partaking of His life and nature to become one with Him as His enlargement and expression.

1 Cor. 2:9, note 3 **To realize and participate in the deep and hidden things God has ordained and prepared for us requires us not only to believe in Him but also to love Him** . To fear God, to worship God, and to believe in God (that is, to receive God) are all inadequate; to love Him is the indispensable requirement. **To love God means to set our entire being—spirit, soul, and body, with the heart, soul, mind, and strength (Mark 12:30)—absolutely on Him, that is, to let our entire being be occupied by Him and lost in Him, so that He becomes everything to us and we are one with Him practically in our daily life** . In this way we have the closest and most intimate fellowship with God, and we are able to enter into His heart and apprehend all its secrets (Psa. 73:25; 25:14). Thus, we not only realize but also experience, enjoy, and fully participate in these deep and hidden things of God.

Eph 6:24, note 2 **The enjoyment of the Lord as grace is with those who love Him.** In this book the phrase in love, which is rich in feeling, is used repeatedly (1:4; 3:17; 4:2, 15-16; 5:2). Later, the church in Ephesus was rebuked by the Lord because she had lost her first love toward Him (Rev. 2:4). One of the main points revealed in this book is that the church, which is the Body of Christ, is also the bride of Christ, Christ's wife. With the Body, the emphasis is on taking Christ as life; with the wife, the emphasis is on loving Christ. Therefore, this book emphasizes and also concludes with our love toward the Lord. The church in Ephesus, the recipient of this Epistle, **failed in the matter of loving the Lord. Such a failure became the source of and main reason for the failure of the church throughout the ages** (Rev. 2—3).

**Ministry Excerpts:**

Life is a Person, and there is no other way to apply and enjoy this Person but by love. **We need to love Him. Some of the saints in past centuries used to pray, "Lord, show me Your love that I may love You** ." We need to pray the same prayer. Once we see the love of Jesus, we will be so constrained, so captured, and so attracted. **We will spontaneously love Him. Then by loving Him, we will enjoy Him. This is life, and since this life is a Person, there is no other way for us to experience Him but by love. Only by loving Jesus can we enjoy Him.**

**Give yourself to love the Lord. No other way is so prevailing, and no other way is so safe, so rich, and so full of enjoyment. Just love Him. Do not care for anything else** …We must continually tell the Lord, "Lord, keep me in Your love! Attract me with Yourself! Keep me all the time in Your loving presence!" If we will pray in this way, we will see what love we will have toward the Lord and what kind of life we will live. We will simply live by the Lord Himself. As long as we love Him from the deepest part of our being, everything will be all right…. **We must learn to love the Lord Jesus. If we would have such a burning love toward the Lord Jesus, we will enjoy all that He is.** Therefore, I do not encourage you to seek anything else. Go to the Lord and ask Him to draw you that you may run after Him. You must realize that the "zoe-life" is such a loving, wonderful Person and that love is the way to deal with Him. (_Life and Building as Portrayed in the Song of Songs_, Chapter 2).

**All spiritual experiences start with love in the heart; if we do not love the Lord, it is impossible to receive any kind of spiritual experience** (_Dealing with Our Inward Parts for the Growth in Life,_ Chapter 4, Section 3)

**First we enjoy the love of God; hence, the love of God is our enjoyment. Then the love of God, which is enjoyed by us, produces in us a love with which we love God** . This is the love of God becoming our enjoyment and producing within us a love for God. On the one hand, this is the love with which we love God; on the other hand, this love is produced by God's love, which is enjoyed by us….Love comes from God to us and becomes our experience and enjoyment. The result is that this love produces a love in us toward God. Therefore, this love comes from God, it passes through us, and it returns to God. What a wonderful, experiential love this is!

In itself God's love is absolutely perfect. There is no need whatever for God's love to be perfected, for it is already perfect and complete. However, God's love becomes the love with which we love Him, and this kind of love does need to be perfected. We love God by the love that is generated in us through our experience of the divine love. Although we may have this love and may love God with this love, our love is still very limited and far from perfect. **Therefore, our love for God needs to be perfected. As we grow in the divine life, our love for God also will grow.** (_Life-Study of 1, 2, & 3 John, Jude_, Chapter 15).

**Hymns**** : **

_ **Hymn 546** _

1I love my Lord, but with no love of mine,

For I have none to give;

I love Thee, Lord, but all the love is Thine,

For by Thy love I live.

I am as nothing, and rejoice to be

Emptied, and lost, and swallowed up in Thee.

2Thou, Lord, alone, art all Thy children need,

And there is none beside;

From Thee the streams of blessedness proceed,

In Thee the bless'd abide.

Fountain of life, and all-abounding grace,

Our source, our center, and our dwelling-place.

_ **Hymn 1154** _

1.I love Thee, Jesus,

And Thy love to me

Draws me, ever to seek Thee

And run after Thee,

Draws me, ever to seek Thee

And run after Thee.

Thou art beloved,

Yea! Altogether lovely,

The One in whom my heart delighteth.

2.Thy love, Lord Jesus,

Is sweeter than wine,

And Thy fragrance of ointments

My heart doth entwine,

And Thy fragrance of ointments

My heart doth entwine.

A fount in gardens,

A well of living waters,

Which streams and flows from Lebanon's mountains.

3.O come Beloved,

On my garden blow,

That the odor of spices

May break forth and flow,

That the odor of spices

May break forth and flow.

My spouse, My sister,

I'm come into My garden

To feast upon wine, milk and honey.

4.Set me, Lord Jesus,

As seal on Thine heart;

Jealousy's cruel as Sheol,

And love's strong as death,

Jealousy's cruel as Sheol,

And love's strong as death.

Much water cannot

Quench love, nor do floods drown it.

All man could give for love is contemned.

(Repeat the last three lines of each stanza)

_ **Hymn 547, ss. 1-2** _

1Something every heart is loving:

If not Jesus, none can rest;

Lord, my heart to Thee is given;

Take it, for it loves Thee best.

2Thus I cast the world behind me;

Jesus most beloved shall be;

Beauteous more than all things beauteous,

He alone is joy to me.

31 - Love
