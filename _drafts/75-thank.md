**Scriptures** :

1 Chron. 16:8 **Give thanks to Jehovah** ; call upon His name; / Make known His deeds among the peoples.

Psa. 28:7 Jehovah is my strength and my shield; / My heart trusts in Him, and I am helped; / Therefore my heart exults; / And **with my song do I give thanks to Him** .

Psa. 100:4 **Enter His gates with thanksgiving** , / His courts with praise; / **Give thanks to Him; bless His name** .

Psa. 116:17 **To You I will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving** , / And I will call upon the name of Jehovah.

Eph. 5:20 **Giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father** .

Col. 3:17 And **whatever you do in word or in deed, do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him** .

Phil 4:6 In nothing be anxious but **in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God** .

Col. 4:2 **Persevere in prayer, watching in it with thanksgiving** .

1 Thes. 5:18 **In everything give thanks** ; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.

**Footnotes:**

Psa. 50:141 This psalm tells us that some of the saints of God were offering burnt offerings and other kinds of offerings (vv. 8-13), but because they were lacking in affection, they would not offer the sacrifice of thanksgiving to God. **Thus, the psalmist, speaking for God, indicated that what God wants is not the burnt offering but the thanksgiving offering.** We can offer certain offerings without being touched in our hearts, but **when we are thankful to God and offer to Him a prayer of thanksgiving, our hearts are deeply touched and we are filled with affection and tender feeling toward God. This is the kind of offering God desires** .

Eph. 5:201 **We should give thanks to God the Father not only in good times but at all times, and not only for good things but for all things. Even in bad times we should give thanks to God our Father for the bad things** .

Col. 4:23 In prayer we need to be watchful and alert, not negligent. Such **watchfulness should be accompanied by thanksgiving. A lack of thanksgiving is an indication of prayerlessness. The prayer life is kept by watching with thanksgiving** .

1 Thes. 5:182 This clause modifies the three preceding exhortations. **God wants us to live a rejoicing, praying, and thanking life. Such a life is a glory to God and a shame to His enemy** .

**Ministry Excerpts** :

It is significant that **in [Philippians] 4:6 Paul does not speak of prayer, petition,** _ **and** _ **thanksgiving, but of prayer and petition** _ **with** _ **thanksgiving. Both our prayer and petition should be accompanied by thanksgiving to the Lord.** Recently I once again learned the lesson of being thankful to the Lord. When I asked the Lord to restore my health, **I was rebuked by Him for not thanking Him for the measure of health I still had.** Whenever we are ill, we need to say, "Lord, I thank You that I am still healthy to a certain degree. Lord, I am ill, but I am not so ill that I cannot minister Christ to the saints. But, Lord, You know that I am not altogether healthy. Therefore, I ask You to improve my health and make me fully healthy again." We all need to learn to petition the Lord in this way. (_Life-study of Philippians,_ Chapter 62, Section 2)

Some brothers raise their eyebrows as soon as trials come to them. They murmur, "Here they are again!" But Peter told us to thank God joyfully that they are here again. **Whenever we praise and thank the Lord, we are above the trials** . **Nothing can put us above the temptations, circumstances, and difficulties more than joy, thanksgiving, and praise** . This is the proper tone of victory; it is expressed in an overcomer…A sister in Chefoo who entered the overcoming experience was under severe trials. Her daughter died within a matter of hours, and her husband was away in a distant place. When the daughter died, the brothers and sisters went over to comfort her. Although her eyes were full of tears, her face was full of joy. She said, "Thank and praise the Lord. Although I do not understand why my child is dead, I am still full of joy." The brothers and sisters tried to comfort her; instead, she comforted them. Such joy cannot be fabricated. Victory is maintained by this kind of tone. One can still praise the Lord joyfully in the midst of trials.

**First Thessalonians 5:18 says, "In everything give thanks." We should give thanks in everything** . **Colossians 3:17 says, "And whatever you do in word or in deed, do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him." These two passages of the Scriptures encompass everything. Whatever we have missed in the other passages is included in these two verses** . I thank and praise the Lord. I can say, "Hallelujah." Others may wonder what is happening to us, **but we can give thanks in everything and praise the Lord for everything. Brothers and sisters, if we do this, we will prevail over every temptation, and we will withstand every trial** . No tribulation or trial will touch us. Those who go this way will find the strength for their temptations. We can thank and praise the Lord for temptations because we have obeyed the Lord….The daily tone of the Christian life is one of endurance and long-suffering with joy. **In everything we give thanks, and in everything we offer praise. This is a life in the third heavens** . (_The Overcoming Life,_ Chapter 10, Section 4)

**Prayer and thanksgiving are like our two feet; one foot cannot walk without the other. Prayer without thanksgiving will not work; thanksgiving without prayer also will not work. Hence, we must not only pray but also give thanks, and we must give thanks with prayer. We must do both simultaneously** . It does not matter which comes first. As long as you have both, you can conveniently walk on the pathway of your Christian life. Likewise, when we take care of and nourish the new ones, **we should teach them not only to pray but also to give thanks** .

As you walk on the spiritual pathway, do not ask whether you should start with your right foot or with your left. Actually, to this day I still do not know which foot goes first when I walk. If you pay your attention to trying to decide which foot should go first, you will probably have difficulty in walking. **Therefore, in our Christian life we should pray and give thanks, and we should give thanks and pray; we should always walk this way. Perhaps before you go to bed, you pray first and then give thanks, but in the morning when you get up, you give thanks first and then pray. Prayer and thanksgiving are the Christians' spiritual feet.** If one foot is missing, walking becomes extremely difficult; if both feet are missing, walking becomes impossible. If Christians do not pray and give thanks, they cannot have a proper Christian life. (_Abiding in the Lord to Enjoy His Life_, Chapter 3)

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 595, ss. 1-2** _

1. There is always something over,When we taste our gracious Lord;Every cup He fills o'erfloweth,Rich supply He doth afford.Nothing narrow, nothing stinted,Ever issued from His store;To His own He gives full measure,Running over, evermore,To His own He gives full measure,Running over, evermore.
2. There is always something over,When we, from the Father's hand,Take our portion with thanksgiving,Praising for the things He planned.Satisfaction, full and deepening,All our need He doth supply,When the heart has tasted JesusIts desires to satisfy,When the heart has tasted JesusIts desires to satisfy.

_ **Hymn 783, ss. 1-3** _

1Pray to touch the throne of God,

Touch the throne of grace divine,

Grace to find and mercy too

Which will meet the need of thine.

2Pray to touch the throne of God,

Deeply sense thy need of grace;

In the spirit stay with God,

Giving God the thanks and praise.

And for the life with Him to live,  
Ten thousand thousand more.
