**Scriptures** :

**Lev. 11:3 Whatever** has a divided hoof, that is, has its hoof split in two, and **chews the cud among the beasts, that you may eat.**

**1 Sam. 12:24** Only, fear Jehovah and serve Him in truth with all your heart, **for consider what great things He has done for you** .

**Psa. 48:9**** We consider, O God, Your lovingkindness** / In the midst of Your temple.

Psa. 63:6 When I remember You while on my bed, / **When I consider You in the night watches** .

**Psa. 119:95** The wicked have waited for me in order to destroy me, / **But I consider Your testimonies.**

**Mal. 3:16** Then those who feared Jehovah spoke to one another, each with his neighbor. And Jehovah gave heed and listened, and **a book of remembrance was written before Him of those who feared Jehovah and considered His name.**

**Heb. 3:1** Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, **consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus.**

2 Tim. 2:7 **Consider what I say,** for the Lord will give you understanding in all things.

**Footnotes:**

Lev. 11:3, note 1 Lit., divides the hoof, that is, splits the split of its hoofs (cf. vv. 7, 26). **Animals that divide the hoof and chew the cud (v. 3; cf. vv. 4-8, 26-28) signify persons who have discernment in their activities (Phil. 1:9-10) and who receive the word of God with much reconsideration (see note 15**** 1 ****in Psa. 119).**

Psa. 119:15, note 1 (muse) Rich in meaning, the Hebrew word for muse (often translated meditate in the KJV) implies to worship, to converse with oneself, and to speak aloud. **To muse on the word is to taste and enjoy it through careful considering.** Prayer, speaking to oneself, and praising the Lord may also be included in musing on the word. To muse on the word of God is to enjoy His word as His breath (2 Tim. 3:16) and thus to be infused with God, to breathe God in, and to receive spiritual nourishment **.**

Prov. 1:7, note 1, par. 2 (fear) **To revere God is to consider and regard Him in everything, never forgetting that He is the wonderful God who created us.** To revere God is to fear God (1:7; 2:4-5; 8:13; 9:10; 10:27; 14:2, 26-27; 15:16, 33a), to trust in Him (3:5-8, 26; 16:20; 30:5-6), and to honor Him (3:9-10). Revering God stops us from doing evil. It also causes us to be touched by the sufferings of others and to show mercy and compassion to them.

Mal. 3:16, note 1 **When we consider, love, regard, respect, and sanctify God's name, God keeps a record of this in His book of remembrance** .

**Ministry Excerpts** :

**Beasts that divide the hoof and chew the cud (vv. 2-3) signify persons who have discernment in their activities and who receive the word of God with much reconsiderationâ€¦.Chewing the cud signifies receiving the word of God with much consideration and reconsideration. Just as a cow chews its cud, we should consider and reconsider the word of God. We may do this while we pray-read early in the morning. As we are pray-reading, we may consider and reconsider the word. This is to chew the cud to receive nourishment by reconsidering what we receive from God's word** .

In [Leviticus 11:] 2 and 3 we see God's wisdom. The two phrases "divides the hoof" and "chews the cud" are very meaningful. **On the one hand, we need to chew the cud, eating the word of God by chewing it again and again. On the other hand, we need to have a walk that is full of discernment.** (_Life-Study of Leviticus_, Message 36, pp. 314-315)

In several verses the writer of Psalm 119 tells us that he mused upon God's word (vv. 15, 23, 48, 78, 99, 148). **To muse on the word is to taste it through careful considering.** Thus, musing is a kind of enjoyment. I can testify that most of the enlightenment I receive comes by musing on the Word early the morning. **As I muse on the Word, I think about it with much consideration in a detailed way.**

In [Psalm 119:] 95b the psalmist said, " **I consider Your testimonies." To consider the Word is to think it over very carefully. Concerning this, we may use the word mull. To consider the Word is to mull it over, even to study it and research it** . (_Life-Study of Psalms_, Message 40, p. 461)

**Hymns:**

_ **Hymn 190** _

1 O Lord, as we consider Thee,

We worship Thee for all Thou art;

Thou art so rich, so wonderful,

So dear and precious to our heart.

What Thou art meets our every need!

Our hearts o'erflow with praise to Thee!

All our desires Thou dost exceed

And satisfy continually.

2Thou art the very God in truth,

The God who is both love and light;

The God who is to us our life,

The God in whom we all delight.

3Thou also art a man indeed,

A man so fine, so good, so pure;

A man in whom our God delights,

A man who can our love secure.

4Thou even art a lowly slave,

A slave of God to serve for us;

Obedient to the cross's death

That we might be delivered thus.

5Thou art, beside all these, a King,

A King in life and love to reign,

By God anointed with His pow'r

To rule with us in His domain.

6Dear Lord, as we remember Thee,

We thus partake of all Thou art;

As we enjoy Thyself in love,

We share Thee as Thy counterpart.

_ **Hymn 656** _

1. "Consider Him," let Christ thy pattern be,And know that He hath apprehended theeTo share His very life, His pow'r divine,And in the likeness of thy Lord to shine.

1. "Consider Him"; so shalt thou, day by day,Seek out the lowliest place, and therein stay,Content to pass away, a thing of nought,That glory to the Father's name be brought.

1. Shrink not, O child of God, but fearless goDown into death with Jesus; thou shalt knowThe power of an endless life begin,With glorious liberty from self and sin.

1. "Consider Him," and thus thy life shall beFilled with self-sacrifice and purity;God will work out in thee the pattern true,And Christ's example ever keep in view.

1. "Consider Him," and as you run the race,Keep ever upward looking in His face;And thus transformed, illumined thou shalt be,And Christ's own image shall be seen in thee.

_ **Lord, we want to live You** _

1Lord, we want to live You

In the most intimate

And the closest contact,

Closest contact with You.

Acting according

To the index of Your eyes;

A person one with Christ,

Full of Christ.

2And one who is saturated

with Christ

One who is so broken

And even terminated

In his natural life,

Softened and flexible

in his will,

Affectionate, yet restricted

in emotions,

Sober and considerate

in his mind,

And pure, genuine

in his spirit.

3This is for the benefit

Of all the believers

That they may experience

And enjoy Christ

For the fulfillment of God's purpose

In the building up of Christ's Body,

In the building up of Your Body.
