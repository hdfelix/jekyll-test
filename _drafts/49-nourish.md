**Scriptures** :

Jer. 15:16 **Your words were found and I ate them** , / And Your word became to me / The gladness and joy of my heart, / For I am called by Your name, / O Jehovah, God of hosts.

Ezek. 3:1 Then He said to me, Son of man, **eat what you find; eat this scroll** , and go, speak to the house of Israel. 2 **So I opened my mouth, and He gave me that scroll to eat.** 3 And He said to me, Son of man, feed your stomach and fill your inward parts with this scroll that I am giving you. **And I ate it, and it was like honey in my mouth in its sweetness.**

Matt. 4:4 But He answered and said, It is written, " **Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God** ."

John 6:57 As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, **so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me** .

1 Tim. 4:6 If you lay these things before the brothers, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, **being nourished with the words of the faith and of the good teaching which you have closely followed** .

**Footnotes** :

Jer. 15:16, note 1 (ate) According to the entire revelation in the Holy Bible, **God's words are good for us to eat, and we need to eat them (Psa. 119:103; Matt. 4:4; Heb. 5:12-14; 1 Pet. 2:2-3). God's word is the divine supply as food to nourish us. Through the word as our food, God dispenses His riches into our inner being to nourish us that we may be constituted with His element.** This is a crucial aspect of God's economy. When we eat God's words, His word becomes our heart's gladness and joy.

Matt. 4:4, note 3 (bread) This word indicates that **the Lord Jesus took the word of God in the Scriptures as His bread and lived on it** .

John 6:57, note 1 (eats) To eat is to take food into us that it may be assimilated organically into our body **. Hence, to eat the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into us that He may be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life. Then we live by Him whom we have received** . It is by this that He, the resurrected One, lives in us (14:19-20).

1 Tim. 4:6, note 2 Or, **nourishing yourself.**** Being nourished is for growth in life, which is a matter of life; **it differs from being merely taught, which is a matter of knowledge.** To minister Christ to others requires that first we ourselves be nourished with the words of life concerning Christ**.

1 Tim. 4:6, note 4 **The words of the good teaching are the sweet words that contain and convey the riches of Christ to nourish, edify, and strengthen His believers.**

1 Pet. 2:2, note 4 (grow) To grow is a matter of life and in life. **We received the divine life through regeneration, and we need to grow in this life and with this life by being nourished with the milk conveyed in the word of God** .

**Ministry Excerpts** :

Another important verse is 1 Timothy 4:6b: " **You will be a good minister of Christ Jesus,** _ **being nourished** _ **with the words of the faith.** " Perhaps you have been in Christianity for many years. Have you ever thought that we must be nourished in the Word of God? As a rule, we always think that we must be "taught" in the Word, by the Word, and with the Word. But how many Christians have noticed the word "nourished"? And how many have ever heard a message stressing the importance of being nourished in the Word?

**But the concept of the apostle Paul was that God's Word is food to nourish God's children. We must be nourished in the Word, not merely taught. Praise the Lord, nourished! Hallelujah, we must be nourished with the Word, not just taught with letters! Paul's emphasis is not that we should be taught with knowledge, but that we should be nourished with the riches of the Word.** (_Time with the Lord, A,_ Chapter 1, Section 2)

**We have to learn how to take the breath of God by exercising our spirit. The way to exercise our spirit is to transform what we understand from our reading into prayer** . Then as we are open to the Holy Spirit, He will grant us many new experiences and new utterances. **Many times when we pray in this way, it is easy to be filled with the Holy Spirit. If we do this, we will have a feast, a rich nourishment. If we have the time, we can try this a second time in the day and have another meal. However, we should at least have one meal a day** . Forget the old way to read the word. Take this new way of practice. Do not care for your concordance; just take the word in a simple way. Open the Bible. Go book by book, chapter by chapter, and verse by verse without skipping. Just keep reading. **Then when you understand something, put it into prayer.** Do not care for how long it will take. Simply pray and let the Holy Spirit have the free way to get into you. Do not make a regulation that you must understand a certain number of items each morning. Simply open yourself very much to the Lord and leave the understanding to Him. Try to learn this way.

Learn this new way. Then the Bible will be living to you. It will be a book of life and the real tree of life. Day by day we will sit under the shadow of this tree and enjoy all its fruits. We will not be killed, and we will not kill others. Neither will we be condemned, nor will we condemn others. **Rather, we will be nourished, so we will be able to nourish others. Learn to read the word in this way. If we all would practice this kind of reading, the church will be very enriched, strengthened, and built up. We will be so rich to nourish others. We will have the life nourishment without the dead knowledge of letters** . May the Lord be merciful to us and deliver us from seeking the knowledge of letters, that we may take the word as the nourishment of life. I would ask you to take this and put it into practice. (_Practical Lessons on the Experience of Life,_ Chapter 13, Section 6)

It is correct to say that Christ nourishes the church with His life and with His word. His life and His word are the substance of the nourishment, but neither His life nor His word is the source. The source is the Father. What Christ receives of the Father becomes the life and the life supply which are embodied in the Word. For this reason, the Word is the word of life, even the bread of life or the supply of life. **If we would be nourished by Christ today, we need to abide in Him to absorb His content into our being as life and the life supply. In order to experience this in a practical way, we daily need to contact the living Word, for the Word is the embodiment of life and of the life supply. The more we abide in the Lord and contact the Word, the more we experience His nourishing. This is the way Christ nourishes the church** .

**All the members of the church need to practice abiding in the Lord. There should be no insulation, no separation, between us and the Lord and no detachment from Him. As soon as we are detached from Him, the supply of nourishment is cut off. Along with abiding in the Lord constantly, we must daily come to the Word and take it in as our life and life supply. Then we will receive nourishment.** Furthermore, all the meetings of the church should be meetings of nourishment. Morning revival and our fellowship with the saints should also be times of nourishment. (_Conclusion of the New Testament, The (Msgs. 323-345),_ Chapter 21, Section 3).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 509, ss. 1-3** _

1A flowing river and a tree,

Eden's outstanding features are,

Man to supply with food and drink

That he may live fore'er.

Chorus:

God is in Christ to be my supply,

God as the Spirit nourisheth me;

If upon Christ in spirit I feed,

Filled with His life I'll be.

2The tree the glorious Christ does show,

As living food to man supplied,

That he God's riches may enjoy,

Thus to be satisfied.

3The river does the Spirit show,

Coming man's spirit to supply,

That with God's riches he be filled,

Holy to be thereby.

._ **Hymn 811, ss. 1-2, 6-8** _

1My heart is hungry, my spirit doth thirst;

I come to Thee, Lord, to seek Thy supply;

All that I need is none other but Thee,

Thou canst my hunger and thirst satisfy.

Chorus

Feed me, Lord Jesus, give me to drink,

Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst;

Flood me with joy, be the strength of my life,

Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst.

2Thou art the food and the water of life,

Thou canst revive me, my spirit upbear;

I long to eat and to drink here of Thee,

Thyself enjoy through my reading and prayer.

6Now to enjoy Thee I come to Thy Word,

On Thee to feed till my hunger is o'er.

Now in my spirit I turn unto Thee,

Of Thee to drink till I'm thirsty no more.

7Feeding and drinking, Lord Jesus, of Thee,

Feeding by reading, and drinking by prayer;

Reading and praying, I eat and I drink,

Praying and readingâ€”Lord, Thou art my fare.

8Here, O my Lord, may I feast upon Thee;

Flood with Thy Spirit and fill by Thy Word;

May, Lord, Thou be such a feast unto me

As man hath never enjoyed nor e'er heard.

_ **Hymn 1135, s. 3** _

Lord, do nourish us; You are the food we need;

As we are eating You, we'll be transformed indeed;

We're fully satisfied as on Yourself we feed,

So nourish us, O Lord, we pray.

O Lord, do nourish us today

As all our self You wash away.

Not only purify,

But fill and satisfy;

O Lord, do nourish us today.
