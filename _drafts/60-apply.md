**Scriptures** :

Rom. 3:25 Whom God set forth as a propitiation place **through faith in His blood** , for the demonstrating of His righteousness, in that in His forbearance God passed over the sins that had previously occurred,

Heb. 10:22 Let us come forward to the Holy of Holies with a true heart in full assurance of faith, **having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience** and having our bodies washed with pure water.

1 John 1:7 But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin. 9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

Rev. 12:10 And I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ, for the accuser of our brothers has been cast down, who accuses them before our God day and night. 11 **And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb** and because of the word of their testimony, and they loved not their soul-life even unto death.

**Footnotes** :

Gen. 6:143, par. 2 In order for the pitch on the ark to be effective, Noah and his family had to be in the ark, i.e., in union with the ark. Likewise, **in order to apply the redemption through Christ's blood, we must be in Christ, i.e., in union with Him by believing into Him** (John 3:16; 1 Cor. 1:30; Eph. 1:7). See notes 212 in ch. 3, 222 in Exo. 12, and 22 in 1 John 2.

Exo. 12:121 The firstborn here signifies the natural man, the old man in Adam. Since Adam was the first man (1 Cor. 15:45a), the firstborn includes everyone who is in Adam (cf. 1 Cor. 15:22a). **The redeeming blood of Christ is not effective for those who remain in Adam** (see note 22 in 1 John 2; cf. note 222 in this chapter). **Furthermore, to apply Christ as the Passover in a complete and adequate way, we must condemn everything within us that is related to the firstborn, that is, to Adam** (1 Cor. 5:6-8; Eph. 4:22).

Exo. 12:221 Hyssop was among the smallest of the plants (1 Kings 4:33). Here it signifies our faith, which God does not require to be great (Matt. 17:20). **The blood of Christ, the Passover lamb, is applied not by great faith but by a small amount of faith. Even a little faith is sufficient for us to apply the blood of Christ that we may enter into Him as the house and have a full enjoyment of the Passover** .

Rev. 12:112 The blood of the Lamb, which is for our redemption, answers before God all the accusations of the devil against us and gives us the victory over him. **We need to apply this blood whenever we sense the accusation of the devil.**

**Ministry Excerpts** :

**We must always apply the blood to our conscience.** However, we should not apply it in a wrong, foolish way, saying, "Maybe I am wrong, so I apply the blood." We must be clear with the enemy Satan. If we are not wrong, we must be bold to tell the enemy, "Satan, I am not wrong." But **if we are wrong, we should say, "Lord, I am wrong in this matter. Forgive me. I apply the blood," and to Satan we say, "Yes, I am wrong, but I have the blood." Then we must reject any kind of accusation** . (_Practical Lessons on the Experience of Life_, Chapter 11)

**To overcome Satan because of the blood of the Lamb means to apply the blood of the Lord Jesus as our covering and to take the Lord**** ' ****s blood to counter Satan**** ' ****s accusations and attacks** . Because we are still on earth and in the body of flesh we cannot help but have some defilement, corruption, weakness, shortcoming, and other undesirable conditions. When we fight with Satan, the first thing he does is to point out all the weaknesses and shortcomings in our conscience and then accuse and attack us. At such times we need to know the power and effectiveness of the blood of the Lamb. **We can apply the blood to answer all of Satan**** ' ****s accusation, and thus we can be strong and of good courage before the enemy and fight with him** .

As we wage war against Satan, we must see the blood and declare that we are under its covering. This blood is the prevailing blood, and it speaks and implies a great deal. Only God and, to some extent, the Devil know how much the blood implies. But whether or not we know all that the blood implies, as long as we apply it, we shall have all it implies. Therefore, we can overcome Satan because of the blood of the Lamb. (_Conclusion of the New Testament, The (Msgs. 157-171)_, Chapter 14)

**We can never come to the Lord without applying the blood** . Not one of the priests could get into the Holy Place without the blood. Regardless of whether we sense that we are sinful or not, we are still sinful, for we are still in the old nature, and we are still walking on this dirty earth. In many ways, consciously and unconsciously, **we have been defiled and therefore need to apply the blood** . We must always be showing others that we cannot live without the scarlet color, meaning that we cannot live without the Lord's redeeming blood. In our expression of Christ we must give others the impression that we always have the realization we are sinful, defiled, and dirty. We always need the cleansing of the blood and must give others the sense that we live by the blood. **We can never enjoy Christ as our life without applying the blood to cleanse us and to cover us** . (_The Priesthood_, Chapter 10)

**When we confess and apply the blood, we will enjoy Christ as our nourishment** . The redeeming Christ will become the showbread to supply, to nourish, and to feed us. When we enjoy Christ in this way by feeding on Him, we are satisfied. Spontaneously, from this inner satisfaction there is something shining and enlightening. That is the lighting of the lamp. Then we know what to utter and express to God. In this way, whatever we say to God is sweet incense. It will issue out of the Spirit with Christ as the sweet and fragrant element. Our prayer will be just like the incense to God.

I have no intention to give you teachings about typology. My burden is to show you the right way to contact God. This is not a kind of teaching, but a certain kind of instruction to show you the proper way to contact God and to enjoy and experience all the riches of Christ in the presence of God. (_The Priesthood_, Chapter 17)

One day a brother came to me, saying, "Brother, whenever I hear you pray, you always say, "Lord, cleanse us with Your precious blood that we may enjoy You more and more." Why do you always ask the Lord to cleanse you with His blood?" "Brother," I answered, "don't you realize that you still have a sinful nature? Don't you realize that you are still living in this corrupt and defiling world? Are you not defiled from morning to evening by many things?" **Whenever we come to experience Christ and apply Him as our life, we must realize that He is not only the plant life, but also the animal life. We must always apply Him as the redeeming One, as the Lamb who has been slain, that we may enjoy all the riches of His generating life** . (_The All-Inclusive Christ_, Chapter 6)

The third major item concerning the anointing is the Lord's blood. The more we intend to learn the lesson of the inner anointing, the more we will appreciate how much we need the blood. Likewise, the more we experience the cleansing of the blood, the more anointing we have. The types in the Old Testament show us that **the anointing is always applied based on the sprinkling of the blood. In the Old Testament times, when the priests came to be anointed, they first needed to be sprinkled by the blood. Where the blood is sprinkled, there the anointing is** .

If we do not have the cleansing of the blood, we do not have the ground for the Holy Spirit to anoint us. The anointing is available only on the ground of redemption by the Lord's blood. The redeeming blood of the Lord is for cleansing, and the Spirit of the Lord is for anointing. We first must be cleansed by the blood of the Lord, and then we can be anointed by the Spirit of the Lord. (_Basic Principles of the Experience of Life_, Chapter 16)

1Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole,

I want Thee forever to live in my soul;

Break down every idol, cast out every foe;

Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

Whiter than snow; yes, whiter than snow;

Now wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.

Apply Thine own blood and extract every stain;

To get this blest cleansing I all things forego;

Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

3Lord Jesus, look down from Thy throne in the skies,

And help me to make a complete sacrifice;

I give up myself and whatever I know;

Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

4Lord Jesus, for this I most humbly entreat;

I wait, blessed Lord, at Thy crucified feet;

By faith, for my cleansing I see Thy blood flow;

Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

5Lord Jesus, Thou seest I patiently wait;

Come now, and within me a new heart create;

To those who have sought Thee Thou never saidst, No;

Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
