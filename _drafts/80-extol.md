Praise highly, laud

**Scriptures** :

Psa. 30:1 **I extol You, O Jehovah, for You have drawn me up** / And have not let my enemies rejoice over me.

Psa. 66:17 To Him I called out with my mouth, / And **He was extolled with my tongue** .

Psa. 145:1 **I will extol You, O my God and King** ; / And I will bless Your name forever and ever.

S. S. 1:4 Draw me; we will run after you—The king has brought me into his chambers— / We will be glad and rejoice in you; / **We will extol your love more than wine** . / Rightly do they love you.

Matt. 11:25 **At that time Jesus answered and said, I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth,** because You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants.

Rom. 15:9 And that the Gentiles should glorify God for His mercy, as it is written, " **Therefore I will extol You among the Gentiles, and I will sing praise to Your name** ."

**Footnotes** :

Psa 145:12 extol **Psalms 140—144 issue in the extolling and praising of God in Psa. 145 for God's reigning in Christ and His kingdom** (vv. 11-13).

S.S. 1:43 rejoice **The fellowship of Christ and His lover in her mingled spirit is in the joy of Christ's lover with her companions ("we"), in their extolling of His unrivaled love** .

Matt. 11:252 extol Lit., **acknowledge with extolment** . **The Lord acknowledged with extolment the Father's way in carrying out His economy** . Although people, instead of responding to His ministry, slandered Him (vv. 16-19) and the leading cities rejected Him (vv. 20-24), He extolled the Father, acknowledging the Father's will. He did not seek prosperity in His work but sought the Father's will; His satisfaction and rest were not in being understood and welcomed by man but in being known by the Father (vv. 26-27).

**Ministry Excerpts** :

Psalm 145 tells how the saints praise God for His reigning in Christ and His Kingdom. Verse 1 indicates that God is the King in Christ: **"I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever." To extol is higher and deeper than to praise. Here the Psalmist extols Christ as the King.** Verses 10 to 13 reveal that God's Kingdom is an everlasting kingdom with glory and majesty: "All thy works (all things on this earth) shall praise thee, O Lord; and thy saints shall bless thee. They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power (power now comes from the city to the kingdom); to make known to the sons of men (all peoples, races, and nations in the entire earth) his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom." Now you can see how the praises of the Psalmists have turned to the reigning Christ and His Kingdom. In all the previous Psalms the praises have been mostly occupied with Christ, the house, and then the city. Now the praise concerns the reigning Christ and His glorious Kingdom over the entire earth. "Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations" (v. 13). (_Christ and the Church Revealed and Typified in the Psalms_, p. 220)

The Lord's surpassing prayer to the Father is as follows:

" **I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants.** Yes, Father, for thus it has been well-pleasing in Your sight" (vv. 25-26). No one in history has ever prayed such a prayer.

While the first God-man was rebuking the cities, He fellowshipped with the Father, answering the Father by His prayer. The Lord's prayer was actually His answering the Father. That indicates that while He was reproaching, He was fellowshipping with the Father. When a father reproaches his children, he should remain in fellowship with the Lord.

**In His prayer the Lord extolled the Father, acknowledging the Father as Lord of heaven and of earth. To extol is to praise with acknowledgment. Mostly we give praise to the Lord without any acknowledgment, but the Lord praised the Father by acknowledging that the Father is the Lord of heaven and earth.** We should learn to praise by acknowledging the Father in His economy, His will, and His doing. (_God-man Living_, p. 111)

As the Lord was rebuking the cities, a third party was present. The Lord was the first party, the cities were the second party, and the Father, who was with Him, was the third party. As the Lord was rebuking Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum, the Father might have...said to the Son, "You are rebuking these cities because they have rejected You. Do You feel good about this?" **The Lord immediately answered and extolled the Father, the Lord of heaven and of earth... .The Greek word rendered "extol" in verse 25 means to acknowledge with extolment. The Lord acknowledged with extolment the Father's way in carrying out His economy. Although people, instead of responding to His ministry, slandered Him (vv. 16-19), and the leading cities rejected Him (vv. 20-24), He extolled the Father, acknowledging the Father's will. He did not seek prosperity in His work but sought the Father's will** ; His satisfaction and rest were not in being understood and welcomed by man but in being known by the Father (vv. 26-27). Christ believed that the cities' rejection of Him was of the Father. What about our situation today? **When we are rejected, opposed, criticized, attacked, and condemned, could we extol the Father?** (_Holy Word for Morning Revival, Matthew Vol. 2_, pp. 124-125)

**We are exceptionally extolling in taking Christ as God's righteousness.**** How do we take Christ as God's righteousness? The key is in living a grafted life with Christ. **Such a grafted life includes dying with Christ, being raised with Christ, and being overcoming and transcending with Christ in our mingled spirit. This is the way for us to take Christ as God's righteousness.

**When we live the grafted life, not living by our natural life, but living by the Triune God, the result is that Christ becomes our subjective righteousness.** When we enjoy the Triune God, Christ is constituted into us as God's righteousness subjectively. Hence, the objective righteousness is for grace to come to us that we may receive Christ as our subjective righteousness. Therefore, God's righteousness is the subjective Christ, the Christ whom we enjoy and experience and who is constituted into us.

**This is something which we should particularly extol and designate. In the Lord's recovery we particularly extol and designate the truth concerning taking Christ as God's righteousness, that is, living a grafted life with Christ.** We do not establish our own righteousness but the righteousness of God, the subjective Christ. (_The Experience of God's Organic Salvation Equaling Reigning in Christ's Life_ p. 58)

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 378** _

1. Savior, lead me up the mountain,Where the Lord alone is seen,Where we hear the voice from heaven,Where the air is pure and clean.

Lead me higher up the mountain,  
Give me fellowship with Thee;  
In Thy light I see the fountain,  
And the blood it cleanses me.

1. Higher up where light increases,Far above all earthly strife,Where the strain of effort ceases,Where in Christ we reign in Life.
2. Savior, keep me up the mountainPressing on toward the goal,Till, as one, we share Thine image,And Thy love and grace extol.

_ **Hymn 791. ss. 1, 6** _

1The priest's position holy is;

He sacrifices e'er to God,

Beholds His beauty, incense burns

Of prayer before the Lord.

Chorus

Let us the incense burn

Of prayer before the Lord;

The lamp we'd light, through day and night

Our praise to Him outpoured.

6We praise Thee for Thine endless years,

Extol Thee for Thy boundlessness!

We praise Thee for Thy fulness vast,

Extol Thee for Thy Perfectness!

_ **Hymn 81** _

1O Lord, Thy being is of old,

Before th' eternal past began!

For Thou th' eternal Father art,

The uncreated, great I AM!

2Although a man with men become,

Yet Thou with God eternal art!

The same completeness Thou dost share,

And infinite as God Thou art!

3Thine origin, the same as God,

Before creation was decreed!

Before the foremost, Thou art first,

None other doth Thyself precede!

4Thou never changest thru all time,

Thy years are to eternity!

None is as lasting as Thyself,

Nor is there any after Thee!

5Just as the Father, diff'ring not,

The same perfection Thou too hast!

Thou art the Alpha and the First,

Thou art Omega and the Last!

6We praise Thee for Thine endless years,

Extol Thee for Thy perfectness!

Admiring all Thy fulness vast,

We marvel at Thy boundlessness!
