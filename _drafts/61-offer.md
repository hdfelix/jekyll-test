consecrate, vow, devote, surrender

**Scriptures** :

Psa. 50:14 **Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving** , / And repay your vows to the Most High.

Psa. 54:6 **I will offer a freewill offering to You** ; / I will praise Your name, O Jehovah, for it is good.

Psa. 110:3 **Your people will offer themselves willingly / In the day of Your warfare, / In the splendor of their consecration** . / Your young men will be to You / Like the dew from the womb of the dawn.

Rom. 12:1 I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to **present your bodies a living sacrifice** , holy, well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service.

Heb. 13:15 **Through Him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise continually to God** , that is, the fruit of lips confessing His name.

**Footnotes** :

Psa 110:32 **In the eyes of the Lord our willing consecration, our offering ourselves to Him, is a matter of splendor** . **Although the church has become degraded, throughout the centuries there has been a line of those who have offered themselves willingly to the Lord in the splendor, the beauty, of their consecration.**

The word may also be translated adornment. The splendor of consecration is an adornment. **If we offer ourselves willingly to the Lord, we will be beautified with a divine, heavenly splendor.**

Psa 110:33 Here Christ likens Himself to a plant that needs the watering of the mild, soft, gentle dew. As Christ is on His way to carry out God's economy, He needs to be watered. **Christ is watered by those who offer themselves willingly to Him. Whoever volunteers himself to Christ as an offering is a young man likened to the dew conceived in the womb of the dawn for watering Christ** .

Rom. 12:14 For the church life, the life of the Body of Christ, to be realized, our entire being is needed. Thus, this chapter speaks concerning our body (v. 1), our soul (v. 2), and our spirit (v. 11). **Our body must be presented to God for the Body of Christ** .

Rom 12:15, par. 1 In ch. 6 the members of our body are to be presented as weapons of righteousness (6:13) for warfare and service. In this chapter, however, our bodies are to be presented as a living sacrifice for the church life. This sacrifice is living because it has life through resurrection; it is not like the sacrifices in the Old Testament, which were all slain. This sacrifice is also holy because, positionally, it has been separated unto God by the blood of Christ from the world and from all persons, matters, and things that are common; and because, dispositionally, the natural life and the old creation have been sanctified and transformed by the Holy Spirit with God's life and God's holy nature for God's satisfaction. Thus, this sacrifice is well pleasing to God.

1 Cor. 6:151 Because we are organically united with Christ (v. 17), and because Christ dwells in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22) and makes His home in our heart (Eph. 3:17), our entire being, including our purified body, becomes a member of Him. **Hence, to practice such membership we need to offer our body to Him (Rom. 12:1, 4-5).**

**Ministry Excerpts** :

In [Psalm 110:] 3 we are told that in the day of His forces, or army, Christ's people will offer themselves willingly "in the splendor of their consecration." **Do you realize that in the eyes of the Lord our willing consecration, our offering ourselves to Him, is a kind of splendor?**** Although the church has become degraded, throughout the centuries there has been a line of those who have offered themselves willingly to the Lord in the splendor, the beauty, of their consecration. Giving up everything on earth, thousands have offered themselves freely to Christ, and with this offering there was the splendor of consecration**. John Nelson Darby was such a person. Darby lived to be eighty-four years of age and, because of his love for Christ, he never married. One day, in his old age, he was staying alone in a hotel and he said, "Lord Jesus, I still love You." No doubt, Darby was a freewill offering to the Lord in the splendor of consecration.

While Christ is fighting, He will be thirsty. Needing some water to drink, He will drink from "the brook by the way." This brook is the overcomers. **Those who offer themselves in the splendor of consecration are the dew of the morning to water Christ, and the overcomers are the brook to quench His thirst.** As Christ is taking the lead to fight through to the end, He will need water to drink, and this water will be the overcomers. (_Life-Study of Psalms_, Chapter 38)

**We need to realize that the power to offer oneself to God comes through His appearance; it comes from His revelation.** Those who talk about consecration are not necessarily consecrated themselves. Not everyone who preaches consecration or understands the doctrine of consecration is a consecrated person. **Only those who have seen God are consecrated persons** . (_The Life of the Altar and the Tent_, Chapter 1)

Consecration is not how much we can give to God. It is being accepted by God and being granted the honor of serving Him. Consecration is reserved for Christians alone; it is not for everyone. Only the saved ones, those who belong to the Lord, can consecrate themselves. **Consecration means that we say, "Lord, You have given me the opportunity and the right to come before You and to serve You." It is saying, "Lord, I am Yours. My ears were purchased by the blood; they belong to You. My hands were purchased by the blood; they belong to You. My feet were purchased by the blood; they belong to You. From now on I can no longer use them for myself."** (_Separated Unto the Lord_, Chapter 1)

We have to consecrate ourselves before we can be His slaves. This consecration is a matter of our own voluntary choice. God does not force us, nor does Paul force us. He exhorted us and beseeched us. **God will not force us at all. He wants us to willingly consecrate ourselves to Him.** (_Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 24: The Overcoming Life_, Chapter 12)

The offering for thanksgiving is emotional and superficial, but the offering for a vow is determined and deeper. Thanksgiving is mostly related to the emotion, but a vow is related to the will. Some saints' consecrations are out of thanksgiving, whereas others' consecrations are out of a vow. **In order to follow the Lord, we need a vow. Marriage involves a vow with no change, no variation, no alteration. The Lord treasures our vow to Him.** (_Basic Lessons on Service_, Chapter 8)

The book of Leviticus begins with our offering of Christ in many aspects to God for the satisfaction of both God and man, and it ends with our devoting ourselves and our possessions to God for our vow to Him. But what does the word devote mean? What does it mean to say that we devote ourselves to God? Some may think that devote is the same as to offer or to consecrate. According to my understanding, to devote is stronger than to offer or to consecrate; it is also stronger than to give, to present, to yield, and to surrender. A devotion must always go with a vow. Something may be offered or given without a vow being involved; but if something is given to a person in a will, that is a kind of devotion with a vow. Such a devotion cannot be changed. For this reason, to devote is stronger than to offer. (_Life-Study of Leviticus_, Chapter 62)

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 471** _

1How can I ever stay away

And grieve Thy Spirit all the day

While Thou dost wait for me?

I now am willing to return,

And wait no longer, for I yearn

Henceforth to follow Thee.

2I offer now without reserve

All that I am and all I have

Thy purpose to fulfill.

Oh, may the Lord accept and keep,

That henceforth I may only seek

To do the Father's will.

3When I look back, what grief and shame

That I've brought none to trust Thy name,

Thy word I've locked within.

Oh, may the Lord anointing give

And richly through my being live,

That I may speak of Him.

4My gracious Lord has giv'n much grace,

Exceeding e'en a friend my place;

I fain would be His bride.

I'd share His life and suffer loss,

Accepting willingly the cross,

With Him identified.

_ **Hymn 441** _

1All to Jesus I surrender,

All to Him I freely give;

I will ever love and trust Him,

In His presence daily live.

I surrender all,

I surrender all.

All to Thee, my blessed Savior,

I surrender all.

2All to Jesus I surrender,

Humbly at His feet I bow,

Worldly pleasures all forsaken;

Take me, Jesus, take me now.

3All to Jesus I surrender,

Make me, Savior, wholly Thine;

Let me feel Thy Holy Spirit,

Truly know that Thou art mine.

4All to Jesus I surrender,

Lord, I give myself to Thee;

Fill me with Thy love and power,

Let Thy blessing fall on me.

5All to Jesus I surrender,

Now I feel the sacred flame.

Oh, the joy of full salvation!

Glory, glory to His name!
