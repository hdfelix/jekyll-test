Consider, ponder, mind

**Scriptures** :

Gen. 24:63 **And Isaac went out to meditate in the field toward evening** . And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, camels were coming.

Psa. 1:2 Rather his delight is in the law of Jehovah, / **And in His law he meditates by day and by night** .

Psa 19:14 - **May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart / Be acceptable before You** , / O Jehovah, my rock and my Redeemer.

Psa. 77:12 **And I will meditate on all that You have done** / And muse on Your doings.

Psa. 143:5 **I remember the days of old; / I meditate upon all that You have done** ; / I muse upon the work of Your hands.

Rom. 8:5 For those who are according to the flesh **mind the things** of the flesh; but those who are according to the spirit, the things **of the Spirit** . 6 For the mind set on the flesh is death, but **the mind set on the spirit is life and peace** .

**Footnotes** :

Psa. 119:151 (muse) â€ƒ Rich in meaning, the Hebrew word for muse **(often translated meditate in the KJV)** implies to worship, to converse with oneself, and to speak aloud. To muse on the word is to taste and enjoy it through careful considering. Prayer, speaking to oneself, and praising the Lord may also be included in musing on the word. To muse on the word of God is to enjoy His word as His breath (2 Tim. 3:16) and thus to be infused with God, to breathe God in, and to receive spiritual nourishment.

**Ministry Excerpts** :

In this message **we need to see that with Isaac there was also the matter of enjoyment. His life was a resting and enjoying life.** The record of Isaac's life does not indicate that he suffered much. Rather, it reveals that he was always resting. **This is proved by his meditating in the field (24:63). Could Isaac have meditated if he had not been quiet and restful? No. In order to meditate we must be restful.** Whenever we are troubled, we are unable to rest. Isaac was always resting. In Genesis 24, he had lost his mother, did not have a wife, and his servant had gone away from him. Yet, he was not troubled. He went to the field to meditate, not to cry out to the Lord. He did not say, "O Lord, what should I do? I have lost my mother, I do not have a wife, and my servant has gone away. Lord, have mercy upon me!" **Isaac did not cry out in that way. Instead, he meditated** (_Life-Study of Genesis,_ Chapter 64).

**Both Joshua 1:8 and Psalm 1:2 tell us that we have to meditate and dwell on the word of the Lord all the time. At ordinary times (i.e., other than the times when we are reading the Bible), we should meditate on the Lord's Word.** We should learn to mold our thoughts according to the thoughts of the Bible. We should be meditating whether or not we are reading the Word. Romans 8:6 speaks of "the mind set on the spirit." This means that we should think of the spirit, set our mind on the spirit, and fix it upon the spirit. This verse does not mean that we should set our mind on the spirit only, but that we should have a mind of the spirit. We should not just concentrate on the spirit, but we should have a concentration that is of the spirit. **In other words, whenever our mind turns, it should always turn to God's Word** . No matter what the circumstances may be, our mind should always be fixed on God's Word. This is a matter not of artificial reminding but of **spontaneous meditating** . Ordinarily, **our mind should be a mind that is set on the Word** . Our mind should not be set on the Bible only when we are thinking about the Bible; it should be on the Bible even when we are not thinking about it. **We should be inclined toward God's Word in a spontaneous way** .

There are two sides to our meditation. On the one hand, we meditate when we read the Bible. On the other hand, we meditate at all times. **When we are reading the Bible, our mind should be meditating on God's Word** . But when we are not reading the Bible, we should also be actively exercising ourselves with our trained mind. It is not a matter of forcing ourselves to think about the Scriptures. The Holy Spirit will direct our thoughts in this direction, and it will become part of our habit. **Once we develop such a habit, we will spontaneously become rich in the Lord** (_How to Study the Bible,_ Chapter 3).

In this way of pray-reading one often wonders whether he is praying or reading. **Our reading becomes our praying, and our praying becomes our reading. As we do this, we should also meditate** ; we need some "selahs." I have said that the selahs in the psalms can be compared to rest notes in musical notation. When we come to a selah, we should stop for a while; we should not hurry. It is not necessarily better to read many verses. **We should stop and meditate.**** While we are meditating, we are turned to our inner being. Prior to this we were turned outward. But by pray-reading, read-praying, and meditating, we become an inward person**. Previously we were wandering and unfocused, but through pray-reading and meditating, we become focused. Our mind no longer wanders, and our unstable soul becomes calm.

This matter has much to do with our spiritual benefit. Many of us have wandering minds. Our minds are always wandering. It is difficult for us to be calm and to pray. Hence, it is difficult for us to live in fellowship with God or to live before His presence. **When we read the word by pray-reading and read-praying, we are saved from this condition. There is no need to pray too much or read too much. We simply need to read a little, pray a little, and meditate a little** . However, we should not let our thoughts wander. **We should meditate only on what we have read and prayed** . Then our wandering mind will be rescued. We will no longer be inwardly confused, and our spirit will become strong. **When we meditate in this way, there will be much prayer and intercession; we will receive burdens, guidance, and commissions from the Lord.** (_How to Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God,_ Chapter 14).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 190** _

1 O Lord, as we consider Thee,

We worship Thee for all Thou art;

Thou art so rich, so wonderful,

So dear and precious to our heart.

What Thou art meets our every need!

Our hearts o'erflow with praise to Thee!

All our desires Thou dost exceed

And satisfy continually.

2Thou art the very God in truth,

The God who is both love and light;

The God who is to us our life,

The God in whom we all delight.

3Thou also art a man indeed,

A man so fine, so good, so pure;

A man in whom our God delights,

A man who can our love secure.

4Thou even art a lowly slave,

A slave of God to serve for us;

Obedient to the cross's death

That we might be delivered thus.

5Thou art, beside all these, a King,

A King in life and love to reign,

By God anointed with His pow'r

To rule with us in His domain.

6Dear Lord, as we remember Thee,

We thus partake of all Thou art;

As we enjoy Thyself in love,

We share Thee as Thy counterpart.

_ **Hymn 169, ss. 1, 8 and chorus** _

1Thou, Lord, to God art precious,

His chosen, His delight;

With oil of joy, anointed,

How comely in His sight.

Chorus

We treasure with affection

Thy perfect comeliness,

Thy sweetness and Thy fragrance,

And all Thy loveliness.

8As on Thyself we ponder

And all Thy beauty trace,

We taste to full Thy sweetness

And rest in Thine embrace.

_ **Hymn 593, ss. 4-6** _

4Thru my death with Christ, from Adam I am free,

Thru my life with Christ, new life is given me!

Minding not the flesh, old Adam cannot move,

Minding just the spirit, life divine I prove.

5Minding just the spirit is God's saving way,

Minding just the spirit, Christ we will display;

Minding just the spirit, we can overcome,

Minding just the spirit, we the race may run.

6Minding just the spirit, we the cross will know,

And His resurrection pow'r thru us will flow;

Minding just the spirit, Christ will.live thru me,

And His life within will reach maturity.

_ **Hymn 165, s. 2** _

2My song shall be of Jesus

When, sitting at His feet,

I call to mind His goodness

In meditation sweet:

My song shall be of Jesus,

Whatever ill betide;

I'll sing the grace that saves me,

And keeps me at His side.
