**Scriptures** :

Deut. 10:12 And now, O Israel, **what does Jehovah your God ask of you except that you fear Jehovah your God so that you would walk in all His ways and love Him and serve Jehovah** your God with all your heart and with all your soul.

Psa. 25:12 **Who then is the man who fears Jehovah?** / Him will He instruct concerning the way that he should choose.

Psa. 25:14 **The intimate counsel of Jehovah is to those who fear Him** , / And His covenant will He make known to them.

Isa. 11:2 And the Spirit of Jehovah will rest upon Him, / The Spirit of wisdom and understanding, / The Spirit of counsel and might, / **The Spirit of knowledge and the fear of Jehovah.**

Mal. 4:2 **But unto you who fear My name will the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in His wings** , and you will go forth and leap about like well-fed calves.

Phil. 2:12 So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but now much rather in my absence, **work out your own salvation with fear and trembling** ;

1 Pet. 1:17 And if you call as Father the One who without respect of persons judges according to each one's work, **pass the time of your sojourning in fear** .

**Footnotes** :

1 Pet. 1:174 **A holy fear, as in Phil. 2:12; i.e., a healthy, serious caution that leads us to behave holily.** Such fear is mentioned a number of times in this book (see reference 17e) because this book's teaching concerns the government of God.

**Ministry Excerpts** :

The Spirit is also the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of Jehovah. **The fear of Jehovah goes together with the proper knowledge** . Before we were saved, we were afraid of nothing because we were ignorant. From the time we were saved by the Lord, we have been receiving a spiritual education and acquiring spiritual knowledge. Today many of us can testify that we would not dare go to a movie or to other worldly and sinful places. **There are many places to which we dare not go, because we have the fear of Jehovah. Someone may ask us to do something, but we dare not do it, because we have the fear of Jehovah** . We dare not buy certain clothes which have the modern appearance of this age, because we fear Jehovah. **We fear Jehovah because of the spiritual knowledge** (_Life-Study of Isaiah,_ Chapter 38).

**In [1 Peter 1] verse 17 Peter urges us to pass the time of our sojourning in fear.** This is a holy fear, as in Philippians 2:12. It refers to a healthy, serious caution for us to behave in a holy manner. Such fear is mentioned a number of times in this book because its teaching is concerning the government of God.

**To pass the time of our sojourning in fear means to walk in a holy fear of God all the time** . The words "pass the time" include every minute of our daily life…Every minute of our sojourning must be in fear. This is related to the holy manner of life. In all our manner of life we need to become holy, separated from the world. Verses 18 and 19 explain why we should pass the time of our sojourning in fear: "Knowing that you were redeemed not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers, but with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, the blood of Christ **." Why should we pass the time of our sojourning in fear? Because we know that we have been redeemed by the precious blood of Christ. It is because we know this that we now pass the time of our sojourning in fear. The point here is that the holy manner of life should issue out from the dear and precious redemption of Christ** (_Life-Study of 1 Peter,_ Chapter 11).

According to verse 18, the blood of Christ has redeemed us from our vain manner of life. This vain manner of life is in contrast to the holy manner of life in verse 15. According to most other references in Scripture, the blood of Christ redeems us from sins, transgressions, lawlessness, and all sinful things (Eph. 1:7; Heb. 9:15; Titus 2:14). Here is an exception: Christ's blood has redeemed us from our old, vain manner of life, because the emphasis here is not on sinfulness, but on the manner of life. The whole chapter emphasizes the holy manner of life which God's chosen people should have in their sojourn. Not only is the Spirit's sanctification for this; **even Christ's redemption is for this—to separate us from our vain manner of life handed down from our fathers. Knowing that this was accomplished with the highest price, the precious blood of Christ, we pass the days of our sojourning in fear.**

Our old manner of life, a life in lusts (1 Pet. 1:14), had no meaning and no goal; hence, it was vain. But now to live a holy life, to express God in His holiness, is our goal (vv. 15-16) (_Life-Study of 1 Peter,_ Chapter 12).

**I would encourage you to spend an hour alone with the Lord to consider the precious blood of Christ shed for you on the cross. This will give you the desire to have a holy manner of life in fear.** You will want to become holy in all your manner of life and to pass the remaining time of your sojourn in fear. If we would live in this way, we need to realize that we have been redeemed, bought, purchased, with the high price of Christ's precious blood. **This realization will cause us to have a living in a holy manner of life, for we shall realize that Christ's precious blood has redeemed us from the vain manner of life. No longer will we want to live in a way that is vain** (_Life-Study of 1 Peter,_ Chapter 12).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 754** _

1. To those who fear Jehovah's nameHow sweet the word the prophet brings:The Sun of Righteousness shall riseWith healing in His wings.

1. It is to those that fear His nameHis healing power the Savior brings;Oh, let us hide with contrite heartsBeneath His healing wings.

1. He is the Sun of Righteousness;And while to sin our being clingsWe cannot know His healing touchOr rest beneath His wings.

1. It is His wings that heal our painsAnd soothe the serpent's poisoned stings;Close to His bosom we must pressTo feel His healing wings.

1. Beneath those healing wings I rest,While all my heart with rapture sings:The Sun of Righteousness has risenWith healing in His wings.

_ **Hymn 151** _

1Sing we the King who is coming to reign,  
Glory to Jesus, the Lamb that was slain;  
Righteousness, peace then His empire shall bring,  
Joy to the nations when Jesus is King.

Come let us sing: Praise to our King,  
Jesus our King, Jesus our King:  
This is our song, who to Jesus belong:  
Glory to Jesus, to Jesus our King.

2All men shall dwell in His marvelous light,  
Races long severed His love shall unite,  
Justice and truth from His scepter shall spring,  
Wrong shall be ended when Jesus is King.

3All shall be well in His kingdom of peace,  
Freedom shall flourish and wisdom increase,  
Foe shall be friend when His triumph we sing,  
Sword shall be sickle when Jesus is King.

4Knowledge and fear of the Lord then shall be  
As the deep waters that cover the sea;  
All things shall be in the splendor of spring  
And all harmonious when Jesus is King.

_ **Hymn 1080** _

1What profit all the labor here?

There's nothing new for you and me!

Remember not the former things,

They're all vanity!

Chorus

Vanity! Vanity!

Vanity! Vanity!

'Tis chasing the wind,

It's all vanity!

2Man's life is full of grief and pain:

Much wisdom bringeth misery!

Increasing knowledge addeth woe!

It's all vanity!

3What good our pleasure and our wealth?

Though joys we have and family,

We'll have our worries just the same!

It's all vanity!

4Days of toil to gain and restless nights:

Though gained without calamity,

When death comes it is gone for aye!

It's all vanity!

5Remember God in days of youth!

Fear Him, and such will be your gain!

With Him you will be satisfied,

For He is not vain!

Chorus

Christ without, all is vain!

Christ within, all is gain!

All things are vain,

Christ only is gain!

_ **Hymn 714, ss. 1, 5** _

1Through all the changing scenes of life,  
In trouble and in joy,  
The praises of my God shall still  
My heart and tongue employ.

5Fear Him, ye saints, and you will then  
Have nothing else to fear;  
Make you His service your delight,  
Your wants shall be His care.
