remain

**Scriptures** :

Gen. 18:16 And the men rose up from there and looked down upon Sodom. And **Abraham walked with them to send them away.** 17 And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do, 22 And the men turned from there and went toward Sodom, **while Abraham remained standing before Jehovah** . 33 **And Jehovah went away as soon as He had finished speaking with Abraham** , and Abraham returned to his place.

**Footnotes** :

Gen 18:33, note 1 **Abraham's intercession did not terminate with Abraham's speaking but with God's** , showing that genuine intercession is God's speaking in our speaking.

**Ministry Excerpts** :

Although God remained at Abraham's tent door for several hours, talking a great deal to him, God did not say a word about His purpose in coming to secure an intercessor. We often act in the same way. Perhaps you want a brother to do a certain thing for you. If you are wise, you will not come to him and immediately ask him to do what you desire. You will first determine his mood by having a talk with him about various matters. At the very end of your visit, as the brother is seeing you to the door or conducting you on your way, you may open yourself to him and tell him of your desire. **However, if he does not linger with you but says, "See you in the meeting tonight," you will realize that his heart is too cold and that he would not be interested in doing what you want him to do. But**** if he says, "I would like to stay with you for a while longer," then you will know that you can open yourself to him.**

When God came to Abraham, Abraham welcomed Him, providing Him water and serving Him a good meal. Although God spoke to Abraham during the preparation and eating of the meal, He did not disclose the purpose for which He came. **Only when God rose up and walked away from the tent and Abraham accompanied and conducted Him and the two angels on their way, did God tell Abraham of His intention.** (_Life-Study of Genesis_, Chapter 51, Section 2)

**Whenever we have the deep sense that God has come to us on a human level, we shall realize that this is the time when God will initiate an intercession for us to carry out.**** For this we must learn to linger in the presence of God **. If He would begin to walk away, we must stay in His presence and** tell Him, "Lord, I don't want to lose Your presence. I want to linger here with You." Your lingering in His presence will open up His heart and draw out His desire **. We have seen that Abraham did not abruptly say good-bye to the Lord but walked with Him for a certain distance. This reveals that, in a certain sense, God is very human.** If we would linger in His presence, He would be so human as not to leave us. ****He would remain with us because of our lingering with Him.** I have experienced this many times. I did not leave God's presence and He did not leave mine. As a result of that lingering, God opened His heart to me and the proper intercession came forth (_Abrahamâ€”Called by God_, Chapter 15).

**We also need to allow God to finish what He is speaking** . This was what Abraham did. He prayed, but God spoke. The Scripture says, "Jehovah went away as soon as He had finished speaking with Abraham" (v. 33). Many times in our prayers we go away as soon as we have finished speaking rather than letting God go away when He is finished speaking. In our prayers we have no thought of God's speaking. We simply speak what we want. After praying, we say, "In the name of Jesus, Amen." Then we leave. We do not care if God is leaving or staying. Let me say this jokingly: It is perhaps a good thing that God's presence is not with us during this type of prayer. If God were with us He would feel very lonely. It is very impolite to meet someone, not allow him to speak, and leave as soon as we are finished speaking. This, however, is the way many people pray to God.

Although Abraham inquired in his prayer, God was the One speaking. In his prayer Abraham did not finish speaking and then walk away. Rather, Jehovah finished speaking and then left. After Jehovah departed, Abraham left. **Can we wait for God to finish speaking before we say, "In the name of Jesus, Amen"? Many times as soon as we finish our speaking, we say Amen. We may say Amen to such a prayer, but has God said Amen? We have finished, but God has not finished. This is a pitiful condition. We have never learned to absorb God, to receive God, and to breathe in God.** We pray in a wild and reckless way. We have never been trained in the matter of prayer. We have never surrendered in this matter **. We have never allowed God to speak. Consequently, we do not gain much God at the end of our prayers. We have not absorbed Him or received very much of Him** .

In summary, when we come to God to breathe Him in, we must first turn to our spirit to touch Him. We should be calm, behold Him, inquire of Him, and learn to wait on Him. We should also muse upon Him, worship Him, praise Him, and learn to intercede before Him. **Later we should allow Him to finish His speaking. Then we can let Him know that we are satisfied. This is the best kind of prayer. It is a prayer that receives and absorbs God** . If we always pray in this way, we will surely receive and appropriate much more of God, and He will surely be our real enjoyment. This is what it means to enjoy God through our prayer. May the Lord graciously enable us to live in this reality! (_How to Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God,_ Chapter 5, pp. 65-66)

Toward the end of our fellowship, if there is still time, we should also worship God. It is rather difficult to describe exactly what worship is and what our inner condition should be when we worship. **We may say that worship is a lingering before God. We should not simply get up and leave as soon as we have finished praising and thanking God. No, we should linger before Him a little longer. This kind oflingeringis the issue of our heart's desire for God. It involves beholding, waiting, and inquiring; we behold God's glory,lingeringbefore Him to wait on Him and inquire of Him. This is not an inquiring related to specific things. Instead, it is a waiting out of a desire to know His will. All these things are included in worshipping** (_Lessons for New Believers_, Chapter 23, p. 330).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 812** _

1I come to Thee, dear Lord,

My heart doth thirst for Thee;

Of Thee I'd eat, of Thee I'd drink.

Enjoy Thee thoroughly.

2Just to behold Thy face,

For this my heart doth cry;

I deeply long to drink of Thee

My thirst to satisfy.

3Thy glorious, radiant face

My heart delights to see;

Here I'd abide and ne'er depart,

Beholding constantly.

4In such a fellowship

Thou, Lord, art grace to me;

My heart and spirit gladdened, filled,

I enter rest in Thee.

5Lord, I would linger here,

Still seeking after Thee,

Continue in the Word and prayer

Till Thou dost flow thru me.

_ **Hymn 809** _

1. Speak, Lord, in the stillness,While I wait on Thee;Hushed my heart to listen,In expectancy.
2. Speak, O blessed Master,In this quiet hour;Let me see Thy face, Lord,Feel Thy touch of power.
3. For the words Thou speakest,They are life indeed;Living bread from heaven,Now my spirit feed!

1. All to Thee is yielded,I am not my own;Blissful, glad surrender,I am Thine alone.
2. Speak, Thy servant heareth,Be not silent, Lord;Waits my soul upon TheeFor the quickening word.
3. Fill me with the knowledgeOf Thy glorious will;All Thine own good pleasureIn Thy child fulfill.
4. Like a watered garden,Full of fragrance rare,Lingering in Thy presence,Let my life appear.

_ **Hymn 1139** _

1. I will get me to the mountain,I will get me to the hill;In Thy death and resurrection,Jesus, take me deeper still.

I will get me to the mountain,  
Willingly would get me there.  
All my self fore'er forsaking,  
One with Thee, O Lord,  
Thy death to share.

1. Still at times I sense the shadowsOf my nature, untransformed;Lord, I'll go unto the mountain,To Thy death to be conformed.
2. On the mountain till the daybreak,Linger I, Lord, thus with Thee,May Thy all-transforming SpiritSaturate me thoroughly.
3. Mingled with Thee on the mountain,Soon my sun begins to shine;Death has worked her deep impression,Now my nature's one with Thine.
