Full of Faith
Believe in the blessing
Exercize the Spirit
...
We need an afterburner.

We don't need to speak in tongues to have this kind of experience. We need:
  
* Empty ourselves, Thorough confession
* Be full of faith
  There are a lot of songs in our hymnal we don't sing anymore - power, wind, strength; 'take it; claim it; believe it..." (the baptism of the spirit).
  I know what this is. Every time before I speak I take some time to claim the outpouring of the spirit upon me. The baptism of the Spirit. It has been poured out already; you have to claim that experience. Believe in the Word and the accomplished fact.
* Exercize your Spirit. Don't wait; no. Now you have to appropriate it, substantiate that fact. That is not by waiting for inspiration, waiting for something to drop on you. You exercize your spirit but not in a mild, gentle way (I cannot breathe enough of Thee...). This kind of exercize is good but not in these occasions; you need a strong exercize of the Spirit so that the breath becomes the wind.
  There is a chapter in the first book on the trilogy on the vital groups; there B. Lee said you have to pray and pray and pray until you experience the economical spirit. The essential spirit and the economical spirit are the same. It's like the wind; when it doesn't move, it's good for your breathing, your survival, existence; but when that same wind blows strongly, it can move big heavy ships.
  
  The church in Irvine needs the 'burner' to be turned up from low to _medium_ and _high_; we need to exercize our spirit. Don't be so bland, nice, or weak. Use your spirit and your vocal chords properly. Our face is in the way; [2 Cor. 5:13](http://online.recoveryversion.org/BibleVerses.asp?fvid=5746&lvid=5746) - For whether we were beside  ourselves, it was to God; or whether we are sober-minded, it is for you.

  Brothers, if you are always mild-mannered, you are like Kent Clark; cant'do anything. Get into the phone booth!

  Where there is the economical Spirit, there is power; power to subdue, to get us out of ourselves, get us out of depresion, to resurrect us. The power to bring us into a revival state. This is where the meeting starts. Changing things outwardly does not work. It is by the intensified exercize of the spirit. Nice guys finish last. Don't be a nice guy. The Bible says, 'The violent take the kingdom by force.' I learned this verse early on in the church life. From then on I decided to not be a weakling in the spirit, a spiritual wimp. This doesn't mean I'm crazy. I resolved to be a spiritual strong person. But this doesn't happen by wishing. You have to go to the 'Gym.' Every meeting is a wonderful gym. Do your cross-fit there; The meeting requires to get into the third heavens, yet you can't even get it off the ground. But you can't do that - you are too nice.

  This is very serious. You need to have that experience. Don't be so... be a (spiritual) man. Abraham Chang, in a meeting, one time in front of many, he stopped and hit me on the shoulder and said, 'Brother Minoru, exercize your spirit!" I also remember when B. Lee for the first time opened the meeting to me on his platform for his meeting. I was going to be the speaker and B. lee would be there. This is in front of an audience that had never heard this 'young punk' speak; I always remember his prayer for me, "Lord, strengthen the spirit of brother Minoru; release his Spirit in a strong way."

  We have the idea that the spirit leads and we follow; this is wrong. You have to exercize your spirit; then the Spirit will follow. If you come to a meeting and exercize strongly, the saints will catch taht wave.

  The men who play profesional sports, they exercize a lot between games. They practice all kinds of shots, they eat really well. Then on game day, they are strict. When they go on the court, they warm up with their jerseys on. Then, when it's game time, and they are set for the referee to throw the ball, they are ready to blast off; every muscle twitching.

  Do we come to the meetings like this? We don't warm up, don't get even ready; what's our condition? Our warm up should be in the car. By the way the time comes, 7:30pm, you are ready to go. I guarantee that if we are like this, the energy level, the spirit, will be very high; Learn to seriously exercize. It's up to us to change the meetings. You don't need to shout and yell. We do need a high intensity of exercize. This exercize is in many formst:

* calling
* praying
* singing
* praising

Tonight, there were 5 brohters here; they were already exercizing. They lifted me up. But the tradition is to wait silently. Wait for what? Remember we bring the Lord's presence. He will be with us, but we bring Him. The New Testament principle is that the human takes the lead and the Spirit follows.
Learn to exercize much over the hymns. Just to read the hymn's verse doesn't require much exercize. We are short on this. Don't take the default way of just repeating. Take the active way of taking a verse and turning into our own words and prayer. Don't just repeat; this is the easy way out. The pro basketball players practice and practice all the shots until they can do them in their sleep. In the same way, learn to pray; turn the hymns into your own words. Learn to do this. if you do this and take the lead, the saints will observe and follow. How about this?

The spirit is ever new, unpredictable. The Spirit is a person. Don't box the spirit up into a particular format. To do this, our spirit, like those muscles, have to be twitching. The littlest movement of that dove, we get it. This is very real in the meeting. The spirit will give you a sense - sing that chorus; say something now (woa, that's not the form of the meeting! the form of the meeting says, 'thou shalt not speak right now'... who says?) In 2 Cor. it says if one has the spirit, he should speak and the other should sit. 

EVery spirit has a 'spirit'; that's the play that the coach is calling. We need to all play by being sensitive to that spirit. Brothers, practice this. In your district brother's meeting, practice. If it's a home meeting, how do you start? Just exercize your spirit. Sometimes when I speak, you know, I am slow and deliberately b/c the words have not come to me yet. Practice. We'll fumble a little bit, we'll drop the ball. But keep practicing. When you sing, sing with your spirit. Not just exercize the spirit, but release it! Oh may my spirit flow! Your spirit may be exercized, but it may not be flowing; it doesn't get to me; it doesn't impact me. "Pride shall not prison me." Learn to let your face go, let go of the cultural inhibitions. Brothers, David danced before the ark and his wife despise (snickered) him. This snickering caused her womb to be closed. The king danced before Jehovah. Brothers, our meeting is lacking in excietement, in rejoicing. Praising means we are done asking; we have it. Learn to praise! Give thanks! We should have more meetings to give thanks

* The second thing is the Word. The Word supplies the content. We need to be in the Word not just to be fed, etc. But to bring food to feed God's poeple. When we come to the meetings, we need to have a word to feed God's people. You all need a particular word, a special word, a rhema word that comes to you that week. This is a word that only you have. Bring it to the meeting. You may have many words, but one is the top. You bring it, dress it, make it presentable with the right 'sauce and spices.' Make it good. If we are all like this, we will have no shortage. For Content you have:
  
* The Bible
* The Life-studies
* The HWMR

We are not short on content brothers; learn to be this way. Too bad today we don't have this word. The default is everyone shuffling the HWMR looking for something underlined. No wonder the meetings are empty and flat. Now, how to speak that word, that's another topic.

####Singing
Brothers, we need to recover singing in the church life. We are quite short. In our home meetings, we _programatically_ shift to "meeting mode." We all need to learn from Dick Taylor. He shouldn't be the only singer in the Lord's recovery. Sing! If anyone is joyful, let him sing praise. No one should sing the blues. No! Let's sing with joy! Singing uplifts us, brings us out of death. Singing heals; it's a medicine. But we don't know the hymns. The spirit should be able to touch us to sing in a particular line. Our repertoire is too narrow. Brothers, I feel we need to really build up the singing life. It'll change us. 

Singing is not for the beginning and for the ending. It has become a form. It should be all the time - interspersed in the prophesyng is a prayer, a song. I think we've lost the singing. Talk about regression.

####Prayer
Prayer includes our calling, praising, our uttering something. Whether it's a supplication, praise, whatever it is. We need to fill our meetings with this.

Isn't this wonderful? We should do this in our daily life and our meeting life. Don't give the saints too many heavy things. And don't go back and start rearranging the chairs. Start here. The revival will come. I challenge all the districts. Don't tell the saints, "hey, why don't you sing?" You be a pattern. Sing. Pray. Speak. 

Also, brothers, please, be happy! Smile!! Happiness is contagious. We should be a happy joyous church. Even your countenance makes a big difference.

We have so many meetings; if we really take every opportunity to practice, then the NJ will be a real game.

Don't be so inhibited. Don't be disorderly, God is not a God of confusion. But don't be so inhibited.

Read: "The Exercize of the SPirit for the Release of the Spirit."

Let's not drop the ball. Let's give one another the liberty to learn and exercize.

We need to have a living with a view of what the Lord wants and what the Lord is after. It starts with your personal regimen. If you are doing things just for you, you will get some benefit. 

Lakers got a new chef that got them all to start drinking beef broth b/c it lubricates their joints, etc; once they saw this, they all started having it (there were some with ACL injuries, and other things). 

I also enjoyed that it's been accomplished; but we have a choice to participate or to sit there and drop the ball. 

We need to practice; we need to come to the meetings ready. When we meet the Lord, we should have many victories 'on our belt.' 

Our coming together almost has lost a reason; it's just a routine. What touched me is the NT principle - the human starts it and the spirit follows. The Spirit does not fall upon us.

Don't say that somehow the meeting is dead and the spirit is not with us. Actually, if there's ever a meeting that does not have the spirit, it's our fault as leading brothers. We need to abide by the NT principle and 

We've gone too far to the extreem of being inhibited; we need to go the other direction. Learn to be exercize and exercize by faith.

B. Lee many times said that it's better to be livingly wrong than being dead right.

It also takes exercize to not have a long face. Often when I'm concentrating to I have this long face. 

Brother Lee often mentioned taht when he spoke, he always looked for the friendly faces. Have a pleasant demeanor. This draws out the spirit. This is part of playing ball. This contributes. It may not be 'shooting a three pointer'; it may be 'setting a pick.'

This is a team sport. We are not looking for heroic prophesy.

I enjoyed that we also need to uplift our regard concerning the meeting; I realize that often I'm not so prepared b/c I have lost my regard of the meetings. B. Minoru shared a lot this weekend concerning the importance of the meeting.

When we 'wing' it, our speaking is not what the Lord wants to speak or we cannot supply the saints what they need.

We also cannot let our feelings rule our thoughts; we have to push our spirit out. 

The Word 'practice' came out. We have to keep this in us. Unfortunately we have the wrong practice of not caring for the meeting, not coming to play ball. Some may be willing to help and play a bit so the meeting can be done and we can go home. It will take time to to change the culture. It could be likely that the next meeting, we may play ball for 10 minutes, yet after that, silence; We may need to practice week by week to push the 'ball time'

It's impossible to get a rocket into outer space with just one stage of rocket boosters. You need three stages. The meetings need the effort of all the saints; we need to drop our own ball. For example, with one verse in a hymn, we need to learn to milk the verse; we shouldn't just use our ball and then fall asleep. Timing makes a huge difference. We may compose a great prayer, but it takes you 5 minutes, then you pray it, you kill the meeting. It takes the meeting back. This may happen also with your hymn calling. The meetings require a lot of sensitivity. 

We haven't spoken much about the 'corporate spirit.' Jacob has a crucial and radical change when he saw that God is the God of the House of God. The brothers among us need to function in tthis way and the saints will learn over time. But a baby will not recognize the corporate spirit so there will be some noise.

The annointing is the channel finder. We are stuck in our procedural, formal mentality. But there is another organ that can help us to find the spirit in the meeting. It may be crazy in a way, but it will not be wild and disorderly. The Corinthians were very exercized but in the flesh and in a disorderly way. But after Paul's perfecting, they were brought in to the Love of God, the Grace of Christ and the fellowship of the Spirit.

In Russia, we had the same burden to help the saints, and we began to help each other to prepare. It's a slow process, but it's a solid process to help the saints in this way. I'm afraid that if we just exercize, the saints may just lean back and 'enjoy' our exercizing.
