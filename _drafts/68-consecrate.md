**Scriptures:**

Exo. 28:41 And you shall put them upon Aaron your brother and upon his sons with him, and **you shall anoint them and consecrate them and sanctify them, that they may serve Me as priests** .

Exo. 32:29 And Moses said, **Consecrate yourselves today to Jehovah** , for every man has been against his son and against his brother, **that He may bestow upon you a blessing today** .

1 Chron. 29:5 - Gold for the things of gold and the silver for the things of silver and for all the work by the hands of the craftsmen. **And who will offer willingly, consecrating himself today to Jehovah?**

2 Chron. 29:31 Then Hezekiah responded and said, **Now you have consecrated yourselves to Jehovah; come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of Jehovah** . So the congregation brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all who were willing in heart brought burnt offerings.

Psa. 110:3 **Your people will offer themselves willingly / In the day of Your warfare, / In the splendor of their consecration.** / Your young men will be to You / Like the dew from the womb of the dawn.

**Footnotes** :

Psa 110:32 **In the eyes of the Lord our willing consecration, our offering ourselves to Him, is a matter of splendor. Although the church has become degraded, throughout the centuries there has been a line of those who have offered themselves willingly to the Lord in the splendor, the beauty, of their consecration** .

The word may also be translated adornment **. The splendor of consecration is an adornment. If we offer ourselves willingly to the Lord, we will be beautified with a divine, heavenly splendor** .

Psa 110:33 Here Christ likens Himself to a plant that needs the watering of the mild, soft, gentle dew. **As Christ is on His way to carry out God's economy, He needs to be watered. Christ is watered by those who offer themselves willingly to Him. Whoever volunteers himself to Christ as an offering is a young man likened to the dew conceived in the womb of the dawn for watering Christ** .

Mat 26:132 **The story of the gospel is that the Lord loved us, and the story of Mary is that she loved the Lord. We must preach bothâ€”the Lord's loving us and our loving the Lord. One is for our salvation, and the other is for our consecration.**

**Ministry Excerpts** :

**Consecration is a gate, and we must be determined to enter through this gate** . Consecration is entering through a gate. We cannot regard this as a doctrine. A person who has not consecrated himself is outside of the gate. Only a person who has consecrated himself is inside of the gate. Therefore, we need to enter through this gate with determination.

**We need to have thorough prayer in which we confess our sins and hand ourselves over to God. The sins, mistakes, contamination, and corruption that we sense before God need to be confessed one by one. All that we are, all that we have, and our everything then need to be handed over to God** . We cannot casually and generally say, "God, I consecrate everything to You." This is insufficient. We need to thoroughly hand everything over, item by item. **We need to hand ourselves over to the Lord. We need to hand over our wife, husband, and children to the Lord. We also need to hand over our education, career, future, and everything to the Lord** . This is similar to a merchant selling his business. He hands over everything of his business, including furniture and stock, to the buyer. **We should have this type of prayer alone before God. For some Christians, consecration is like a second salvation. Therefore, the more thorough it is, the better.**

**Consecration is not only a gate but also a path. In all spiritual matters, we must first step inside the gate and then walk on the path.** The principle in the Bible is not to walk on the path and then enter through the gate. The biblical principle is that we first enter through the gate and then walk on the path (Matt. 7:13-14). This is the God-ordained order. Therefore, after we enter through the gate of consecration, we must continue to walk on the path of consecration. Although entering through the gate is once and for all, walking on the path requires a continual renewing, a daily consecration. **Numbers 28 through 29 show a type of consecration. God charged the Israelites to offer the burnt offering daily. They had to daily offer the burnt offering in the morning and in the evening. They could not say that they had offered a sacrifice yesterday and therefore did not need to offer one today. Consecration, like eating, is a daily matter** . Furthermore, the Israelites had to present burnt offerings on every Sabbath, at the beginning of every month, and during every feast. They also had to present an offering at other important times. This shows that after we have entered through the gate of consecration, we need to consecrate ourselves before God every morning. The first thing we should say after we get up every morning is, "Lord, I place myself in Your hands again this morning." At night when the day is over, we should go before Him again and say, "I give myself to You again." When we need to do specific things, we need to say, "Lord, I present myself to You once again." Whether we are going to study, teach, take up a post in the government, give a message, or visit the brothers, we should first present a burnt offering, consecrating ourselves to God. (_Lessons for New Believers_, pp. 59-61)

**All our problems today are due to our unfaithfulness in consecration** . We may not have a morning watch, for example, because of a problem with our consecration. **Many of us have passed the crisis, but we have not continued on the way. Therefore, in order for a church to be built up, the first foundation we must lay is the matter of consecration. We need to check with ourselves and deal with our consecration, and then we need to help others.** We need to pray, fellowship, and encourage the brothers and help them one by one to come into the real experience of consecration.

We may say that we do not have much faith. The reason we do not have faith is that we are not faithful to our consecration. **When we are faithful to our consecration, we have a living faith** . We may say that we do not have power. The reason again is that we are not faithful to our consecration. When we are faithful to our consecration, we have the ground to claim the power, and it is ours. **We need to go to the Lord once again to deal with and clear up our consecration. If we do this, we will see the blessings. Then we will have a burden to help others** .

**We may have consecrated ourselves to the Lord after we were regenerated, but the problem is whether or not we have continued in our consecration. The unfaithfulness to our consecration is the reason why many of us have not grown much and advanced on the Lord's way. We may compare this to someone who walks all the time but does not walk on the right way.** We may come to the meetings, fellowship with the saints, and do many things in the Christian life, but we may not be on the proper way. To go on is a matter of consecration. **Whenever the Lord points out something to us, we need to say, "Lord, I let You have it." If we do this, we advance by one step, but if we do not let the Lord have the victory, we are not on the way, regardless of how many things we do. To go on the proper Christian way is to take step after step in our consecration** .

**We have to go on by consecration day by day. A day without consecration is a wasted day. If we have a struggle with the Lord and we win the victory, making the Lord the defeated One, then regardless of how much we do for the Lord we will only waste our time. The measure of our life and going on is our consecration** . (_Practical Lessons on the Experience of Life_, pp. 35-36)
