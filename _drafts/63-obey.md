**Scriptures** :

Exo. 19:5 Now therefore **if you will indeed obey My voice** and keep My covenant, then **you shall be My personal treasure** from among all peoples, for all the earth is Mine.

Deut. 30:16 **If you obey the commandments of Jehovah your God** , which I am commanding you today, to love Jehovah your God and walk in His ways and keep His commandments and His statutes and His ordinances, **then you will live and multiply** , and Jehovah your God will bless you in the land which you are entering to possess.

1 Sam. 15:22 And Samuel said, / Does **Jehovah delight in** burnt offerings and sacrifices / As much as in **obeying the voice of Jehovah? / Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice** , / And to heed, than the fat of rams.

Acts 5:32 And we are witnesses of these things, and so is **the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him** .

1 Pet. 1:22 Since **you have purified your souls by your obedience to the truth** unto unfeigned brotherly love, love one another from a pure heart fervently.

**Footnotes** :

S.S. 4:11 **This verse portrays the beauty of Christ's lover** in her singleness and insight by the Spirit (eyes like doves), which is invisible to the outsiders (behind your veil), and **in her submission and obedience through God's feeding (hair like a flock of goats) that subdues her disobedience among the disobedient people** .

John 9:73 His going and washing indicates that he obeyed the life-giving word of the Lord. So he received sight. If he had not gone to wash off the clay after having been anointed with it, the clay would have blinded him even more. **Our obedience to the Lord's anointing cleanses us and brings us sight.**

Acts 5:323 **Obedience is the way and the condition for one to receive and enjoy the Spirit of God** .

Phil. 2:123 I.e., carry out, bring to the ultimate conclusion. We have received God's salvation, which has as its climax our being exalted by God in glory as the Lord Jesus was (v. 9). **We need to carry out this salvation, to bring it to its ultimate conclusion, by our constant and absolute obedience with fear and trembling. We have received this salvation by faith; now we must carry it out by obedience, which includes our being genuinely one in our soul (v. 2)** . To receive this salvation by faith is once for all; to carry it out is lifelong.

1 Pet. 1:222 Our soul is composed of our mind, emotion, and will, which are also parts of our heart. To have our soul purified is to have our mind, emotion, and will, as parts of our heart, purified from any kind of defilement or contamination (Acts 15:9; James 4:8). Actually, this means to have our mind, emotion, and will delivered from all things other than God and fixed on God as the sole object and unique goal. **This kind of purification is accomplished by our obedience to the truth, which is the content and reality of our faith (see note 11, point 2, in 1 Tim. 1). When we obey the truth, the content and reality of our faith in Christ, our entire soul is concentrated on God and is thus purified from all things other than God.**** This is to have our souls saved from all filthiness by our receiving the implanted word (James 1:21), which is the sanctifying truth (John 17:17).**

**Ministry Excerpts** :

**We must believe and also obey. Not only do we need to obey once, but we must obey continuously** . Otherwise, we will come short and be unbalanced. Obedience without faith is powerless. Faith without obedience is idealistic. It is very painful to be obedient without faith. **Please remember the scriptural principles for our living: believing and obeying** . We cannot believe without obeying or obey without believing. To believe and yet not obey is false belief. To obey and yet not believe is asceticism. Today in the Lord's church, men either err in faith or in obedience. Every failure is the result of a shortage in one of the two or in both. There is either faith without obedience or obedience without faith, or there is neither faith nor obedience. (_Fact, Faith, and Experience_, Chapter 10)

**To set the mind on the spirit is to obey the sense of life, and the result is life and peace.** Life is satisfaction, and peace is rest. If we set our mind on the spirit and obey the sense of life, we will inwardly feel satisfaction and rest, and we will feel contented and peaceful. Otherwise, we will feel dissatisfied, as if we were missing something. We will feel restless and bothered, as if there were some problem. **Obeying the sense of life is the only way for our life to be nourished and for our hearts and spirits to obtain rest** . This is true even in the matters of preaching the Word and prayer. We must set the mind on the spirit to be able to touch the Lord's presence, that is, to touch life and peace. When we obey the sense of life, the more we preach, the more we feel satisfied and receive the inward supply. The more we pray, the more we are at peace and feel watered in spirit. This sense of satisfaction and rest is the result of obeying the sense of life. (_Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures, Vol. 2_, Chapter 5)

**We must obey God in two matters: One is to obey God's commandments, and the other is to obey His discipline** . On the one hand, we have to obey God's word, that is, His commandments. We have to obey all of God's ordinances written in the Bible. On the other hand, we must subject ourselves to God's arrangement in the environment. We must obey His discipline. Often, obedience to God's word is enough. But there are times when we have to subject ourselves to God's discipline as well. God has ordered many things in our environment, and we must gain profit and learn lessons from these things. This is the profit God has ordained for us. **He wants to lead us to the straight path. We must learn to obey not only His commandments but also His discipline. Obedience to God's discipline may involve a price, but it puts us on the straight path.**

Obedience is not an empty word. Quite a number of the brothers ask, "What should I obey?" The answer to this question is simple. We may think that we have nothing to obey, but when God disciplines us a little, we immediately think of ways of escape. It is strange that many people seem to have no commandment to obey! **Please bear in mind that when God's hand of discipline is upon us, that is the very time we have to obey.** Some may ask, "Why do you not call God's hand the hand of guidance? Why do you call it the hand of discipline? Why do you not say that God is guiding us all the way, rather than God is disciplining us?" God knows how terrible our temper is, and we also know. There are many people to whom obedience will never come without proper discipline. (_New Believers Series: Discipline of God, The #19_, Chapter 1)

Obedience is the other end of authority. In order to have obedience, one must first keep the self out of the picture. **One must not try to obey with the self. There is the possibility of obedience only by living in the spirit. Obedience is the highest expression of response to God's will.** (_Authority and Submission_, Chapter 1)

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 582** _

1. When we walk with the LordIn the light of His Word,What a glory He sheds on our way;While we do His good will,He abides with us still,And with all who will trust and obey.

Trust and obey,  
For there's no other way  
To be happy in Jesus,  
But to trust and obey.

1. Not a shadow can rise,Not a cloud in the skies,But His smile quickly drives it away;Not a doubt or a fear,Not a sigh or a tear,Can abide while we trust and obey.

1. Not a burden we bear,Not a sorrow we share,But our toil He doth richly repay;Not a grief or a loss,Not a frown or a cross,But is blest if we trust and obey.

1. But we never can proveThe delights of His love,Until all on the altar we lay;For the favor He shows,And the joy He bestows,Are for them who will trust and obey.

1. Then in fellowship sweetWe will sit at His feet,Or we'll walk by His side in the way;What He says we will do;Where He sends, we will go,Never fear, only trust and obey.

_ **Hymn 657** _

1. Can you be obedientTo the Lord of all,Though the earth should totter,Though the heav'ns should fall?Face e'en a disasterWith a faith-filled heart,Knowing naught can harm himWho with Christ will start?

1. Can you be obedientTo the Lord you serve,Never even flinch, friend,Never even swerve;Though your next step onwardSeem to lead to death?Can you then obey HimWithout bated breath?

1. Can you trust your LeaderWhen He bids you goRight into a battleWith a mighty foe?Can you step up brisklyAnd with joy obey?Can you fight the battle,Till the end of day?

1. Can you? Then beloved,Christ just waits for you;Listen for His orders,Glad His will to do;Then when soldiers musterAt the set of sun,And your name is mentioned,Christ will say, "Well done."
