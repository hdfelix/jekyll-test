**Scriptures** :

Josh. 1:8 **This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall muse upon it day and night** so that you may be certain to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous and then you will have success.

1 Chron. 16:9 Sing to Him; sing psalms to Him; / **Muse upon all His wondrous deeds** .

Psa. 77:6 I remember my song in the night; / **I muse with my own heart, and my spirit carefully searches.**

Psa. 77:12 And I will meditate on all that You have done / And **muse on Your doings** .

Psa. 104:34 **May my musing be sweet to Him** ; / I will rejoice in Jehovah.

Psa. 119:15 **I will muse upon Your precepts** / And regard Your ways.

Psa. 119:148 **My eyes anticipated the night watches, / That I might muse upon Your word** .

Psa. 145:5 **Upon the glorious splendor of Your majesty / And upon Your wondrous works I will muse** .

**Footnotes** :

Josh. 1: 81 **Joshua was to be occupied with God's word and to let the word occupy him (cf. Col. 3:16). By being occupied and filled with the word, he would have prosperity and success in taking the God-promised good land** . See note 151 in Psa. 119.

Psa 119:151 Rich in meaning, **the Hebrew word for muse** (often translated meditate in the KJV) **implies to worship, to converse with oneself, and to speak aloud. To muse on the word is to taste and enjoy it through careful considering. Prayer, speaking to oneself, and praising the Lord may also be included in musing on the word** . To muse on the word of God is to enjoy His word as His breath (2 Tim. 3:16) and thus to be infused with God, to breathe God in, and to receive spiritual nourishment.

**Ministry Excerpts** :

We should not think that it is a waste of time to temporarily set aside other matters in our prayers while we meditate on God. God already knows our needs. **What touches His heart the most and gives Him the sweetest thought is our musing on Him in His presence. This is the reason the psalmist says, "May my musing be sweet to Him" (104:34)** . We should remain in His presence and behold Him in silence. **While we behold Him in this way, we inquire of Him, wait on Him, and muse on Him** . We can muse on His dealings with us and on His dealings with the saints of old. We can also muse on the sweetness of His person. We can meditate on His desire, love, patience, character, glory, and sweetness. **In this musing, we absorb God, and His elements fill us. We should gain this experience and learn this lesson.**

Please trust in my word. We must leave our many affairs, our business, health, family, finance, and livelihood, in God's hand and remember His promise that our heavenly Father knows that we need all these things (Matt. 6:32). We must cast all our anxiety on Him (1 Pet. 5:7). There is no need to spend much time praying for these things. There is no need to pray for every point. We should believe that He bears the responsibility for all our needs. **In our prayers we should forget about ourselves and spend more time to muse on Him, allowing Him and His acts to fill our spiritual eyes and inward senses. God treasures this type of musing;** He appreciates this kind of meditation. When we enjoy Him in this musing, He dispenses Himself into us and takes care of all our other needs. We should be at peace and focus on His sweetness instead of focusing on our own affairs. **We need to spend time to muse upon His sweetness** . (_How to Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God,_ Chapter 5, Section 3)

Concerning musing upon the Word, verse 147 says, "I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word." Here we see that the psalmist rose up before dawn, cried out, and hoped in God's word. Verse 148 goes on to say, "Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might muse upon thy word" (Heb.). The psalmist woke up during the night to muse upon God's word. Musing upon the Word involves more than just meditating on it. **We muse upon the Word by talking to God, worshipping Him, enjoying Him, receiving grace from Him, and conversing with ourselves in the Lord's presence. We cannot describe adequately the practice of musing on the Word of God and the enjoyment this affords us.**

The seekers of God in the Old Testament mused upon His living word. Their way of handling the Word of God was different from that followed by many today who mainly exercise their mind to study the Word in letter. **As the psalmists mused upon the Word of God, they spoke to God, prayed, worshipped Him, and even bowed down to Him. In the presence of God, they spoke to themselves of His mercy, salvation, and gracious supply. Musing upon the Word in this way is even richer, broader, and more inclusive than pray-reading, for it includes prayer, worship, enjoyment, conversation, bowing down, and even lifting up our hands to receive God's word. It also includes rejoicing, praising, shouting, and even weeping before the Lord** . In _Pilgrim's Progress_ there is a place where the pilgrim reads the Bible and weeps, shouts, and repents. This indicates that he not only read the Scriptures, but also mused upon them. If we muse upon the Word of God, we shall delight ourselves in the Word. Sometimes we may weep before the Lord or sing hymns of praise to Him. (_Life-Study of Exodus,_ Chapter 57, Section 1)

Good prayer often does not need many words. **At times we do not need to say anything when we pray. We can simply muse on God. He cares for our musing. Psalm 104:34 says, "May my musing be sweet to Him."** Prayers in which we continually speak to God may not be good prayers. **In good prayer we behold God and muse upon Him.**

**We may think that musing is something of our mind, but it is actually connected to our spirit** . We actively muse upon the attributes of our God in our spirit. He is fine, tender, careful, dignified, glorious, and great. We muse upon His dealings with us and His promises to us. As we muse, our inner being is filled with much feeling. Our musings are prayers, and at the same time they are not prayers. They are like words, yet they are not like words. **They are thoughts that arise from our inner being and are a delight to God.**

**In summary, we should turn to our spirit to touch God in prayer. These prayers do not require many words. Sometimes it is best to spend some time to look at God or remain silent in His presence.** We should learn to pray in this way. We should never pray with our own burdens; rather, we should set aside our burdens. We should say, "Lord, I give all my burdens to You and come to You with an unloaded spirit." **We should be calm, turn to our spirit, and behold Him. We should then pray according to the inward sense. As we pray, we should continue to behold Him. We should also wait and muse on Him. If we do this, we will touch and absorb God richly through prayer** . (_How to Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God,_ Chapter 21, Section 2)

We should not only pray, but also sing and psalm. The Christians at the time of Paul probably sang the Old Testament psalms, perhaps using certain Jewish melodies. **We today should pray-read, sing-read, and even psalm-read. We should psalm the verses of the Bible. Singing the Word is more inspiring than merely reading it. Psalming is a type of singing that includes musing. Singing itself does not include much musing, but in psalming we muse upon the Word. At such times we may worship the Lord, have fellowship with Him, or even converse with ourselves in the Lord's presence. This is the way to receive nourishment from the Word** . By taking the Bible in this way we receive the riches of God through the Word. The written Word then becomes the channel through which God's riches are conveyed to us. **But if we would receive these riches, we must have a living, organic, dynamic contact with God whenever we touch the Word of God.** (_Life-Study of Exodus,_ Chapter 58, Section 1)

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 165, s. 2** _

2My song shall be of Jesus

When, sitting at His feet,

I call to mind His goodness

In meditation sweet:

My song shall be of Jesus,

Whatever ill betide;

I'll sing the grace that saves me,

And keeps me at His side.

_ **Hymn 169, ss. 1, 8 and chorus** _

1Thou, Lord, to God art precious,

His chosen, His delight;

With oil of joy, anointed,

How comely in His sight.

Chorus

We treasure with affection

Thy perfect comeliness,

Thy sweetness and Thy fragrance,

And all Thy loveliness.

8As on Thyself we ponder

And all Thy beauty trace,

We taste to full Thy sweetness

And rest in Thine embrace.

_ **Hymn 190,** __ **ss. 1, 6 and chorus** _

1 O Lord, as we consider Thee,

We worship Thee for all Thou art;

Thou art so rich, so wonderful,

So dear and precious to our heart.

What Thou art meets our every need!

Our hearts o'erflow with praise to Thee!

All our desires Thou dost exceed

And satisfy continually.

6Dear Lord, as we remember Thee,

We thus partake of all Thou art;

As we enjoy Thyself in love,

We share Thee as Thy counterpart.
