plea, beg, besought

**Scriptures** :

Deut. 3:23 **And I pleaded with Jehovah** at that time, saying,

2 Sam. 12:16 And **David besought God for the child** ; and David fasted and went in and spent all night lying on the ground.

Jer. 12:1 You are righteous, O Jehovah, / When I plead my cause with You; / Yet I will speak with You of Your judgments: / Why does the way of the wicked prosper? / Why are all those who deal treacherously at ease?

Mark 10:47 And when he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, **he began to cry out and say, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!** 50 And throwing his garment aside, he leaped up and came to Jesus. 51 And Jesus answered him and said, What do you want Me to do for you? And the blind man said to Him, **Rabboni, that I may receive my sight** !

Luke 5:12 And while He was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy. And **when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and begged Him, saying, Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me** .

Acts 4: **31 And when they had so besought** , the place in which they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with boldness.

Rom. 11:2 God has not cast away His people whom He foreknew. **Or do you not know what the Scripture says in the passage concerning Elijah, how he pleads with God** against Israel? 3 "Lord, they have killed Your prophets, they have torn down Your altars; and I am left alone, and they are seeking my life."

**Ministry Excerpts** :

**In the life of each one of us, there needs to be a period of time, perhaps lasting for several days, in which we thoroughly repent, confess our sins to God, and plead with Him to deal with our sins and with our sinful nature** . Furthermore, day by day we need to repent and confess. (_Life-Study of Psalms_, Chapter 23, Section 4)

Finally, if we want to understand God's will, we must have and use spiritual wisdom and understanding. Wisdom refers to the knowledge in our spirit that causes us to have an extraordinary seeing of the will of God. Understanding refers to the understanding in our mind that allows us to ordinarily understand God's will. Wisdom is in our spirit, so it is spiritual. Although understanding is in our mind, it should also be spiritual. This requires that our mind be renewed by the Holy Spirit and be full of the Holy Spirit's enlightenment and inspiration. We must have and use such wisdom and understanding to understand the will of God. We must ask God for this wisdom (James 1:5). **We must beg God to give us the power to understand and to open the eyes of our heart. We also need to earnestly deal with our spirit and heart so that everything unclean and unrighteous in our spirit and heart is removed, making our spirit upright and bright and our mind fresh and clean.** Furthermore, we need to exercise, that is, to practice using our spirit and our renewed mind. Then our spirit will have wisdom from God, and our mind will have spiritual understanding so that we can know and understand the will of God. (_Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures, Vol. 2_, Chapter 10, Section 4).

Brothers, we need the anointing of the Spirit upon us. We need to learn to expect the anointing. Many times we have to say to the Lord, "Lord, anoint Your word once more today so that I can take it and use it." When we stand in front of others, we have to say to the Lord, "Anoint the words that I am about to speak and release them with Your anointing." **Now is the time to plead for mercy.** All of the problems are with the ministers. Without God's word, the ministers are poor and the church is poor. It seems that too many people are setting their hopes on truth and knowledge. Few have set their hopes on revelation. In the end the gospel is preached, but few souls are saved. Messages are delivered, but few receive any blessing. If God's life does not follow His word, everything is in vain and is worthless. Our failure lies in the fact that we only see men praising God's word and God's preachers. Yet the words themselves do not convey burning light; the revelation is not strong enough to knock men to the ground. **What is needed today is not more admiration of God's word, but more men falling on their faces at God's light.** If as ministers we cannot accomplish this, we can only blame ourselves for the failure. May the Lord be merciful to us. (_Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The_ (_Set 3) Vol. 53_: The Ministry of God's Word, Chapter 8, Section 5)

In summary, the Holy Spirit puts God's word into us. It is His responsibility to tell us what we should speak. But He leaves the decision of how and when we should speak to us. God entrusts us and believes in us. His charge is that the spirits of prophets be subject to prophets. How grave is the responsibility of the prophets! The way of the ministry of the word is the way of releasing God's word through man's mind and man's word. If our contribution is not up to the proper standard, God's word is no longer His word. This brings in serious consequences! It is easy for God to speak from the heavens. It is easy for Him to speak through the angels. But He loves us and has chosen us. It is indeed unfortunate if we become an obstacle to Him everywhere and in everything. We are often proven to be useless vessels. **In order for God to secure ministers of the word, we have to beg for mercy. We have to say to the Lord, "I will not let You go unless I receive mercy from You."** If we do not receive mercy from Him, His word will stop with us. Today the entire responsibility rests upon our shoulders. (_Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 53_: The Ministry of God's Word, Chapter 4, Section 5)

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 846, ss. 1-3** _

1Oh, may my spirit flow,

Oh, may it flow!

Now I beseech Thee, Lord

Oh, may it flow!

My past I would forsake,

The iron walls would break,

My spirit free would make;

Oh, may it flow!

2 Oh, may my spirit flow,

Oh, may it flow!

Now I implore Thee, Lord,

Oh, may it flow!

No more self-satisfied,

No more in self-bound pride,

No more my spirit tied;

Oh, may it flow!

3 Oh, may my spirit flow,

Oh, may it flow!

For this I plead with Thee,

Oh, may it flow!

High-minded not to be,

Pride shall not prison me,

I'd flow unceasingly,

In spirit flow.

_ **Hymn 398** _

1. O to be like Thee! blessed Redeemer;This is my constant longing and prayer;Gladly I'll forfeit all of earth's treasures,Jesus, Thy perfect likeness to wear.

O to be like Thee! O to be like Thee!  
Blessed Redeemer, pure as Thou art;  
Come in Thy sweetness, come in Thy fullness;  
Stamp Thine own image deep on my heart.

1. O to be like Thee! full of compassion,Loving, forgiving, tender and kind,Helping the helpless, cheering the fainting,Seeking the wand'ring sinners to find.
2. O to be like Thee! lowly in spirit,Holy and harmless, patient and brave;Meekly enduring cruel reproaches,Willing to suffer, others to save.
3. O to be like Thee! Lord, I am coming,Now to receive th' anointing divine;All that I am and have I am bringing;Lord, from this moment all shall be Thine.

1. O to be like Thee! While I am pleadingPour out Thy Spirit, fill with Thy love.Make me a temple meet for Thy dwelling,Fit for a life which Thou wouldst approve.

_ **Hymn 279, ss. 1, 6 & chorus** _

1First the blood, and then the ointment,

Cleansing, then anointing comes;

If we pass not thru Golgotha,

Ne'er to Pentecost we'll come.

If the blood has never cleansed us,

Ne'er the Spirit's pow'r we'll know,

If for Christ we'd truly witness,

Self-life to the Cross must go.

Chorus

Through the Cross, O Lord, I pray,

Put my soul-life all away;

Make me any price to pay,

Full anointing to receive.

6Since it must be thus, I pray, Lord,

Help me go the narrow way;

Deal with pride and make me willing

Thus to suffer, Thee t'obey.

I for greater power pray not,

Deeper death is what I need;

All the meaning of the Cross, Lord,

Work in me-for this I plead.

_ **Hymn 280 ss. 1, 2 & chorus** _

1Lord, may Thy blood now cleanse me,

Wash all my sins away,

That with Thy Holy Spirit

Thou may anoint, I pray.

My service, I confess, Lord,

Is failure-full and weak;

The filling of Thy Spirit

To live for Thee I seek.

Chorus

Oh, from myself deliver,

From all its misery;

I'd henceforth be forever

Completely filled with Thee.

2Oh, Lord, how dry my heart is,

It yearns and pants for Thee;

The filling of Thy Spirit

Is now my fervent plea.

Within the smitten Rock, Lord,

I would entirely hide;

Pour thru Thy living water,

Till I am satisfied.
