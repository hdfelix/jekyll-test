earnest strong desire, long, feel affection

**Scriptures** :

Psa. 84:2 **My soul longs, indeed even faints, / For the courts of Jehovah** ; / My heart and my flesh cry out / To the living God.

S.S. 5:4 My beloved put his hand into the opening of the door, / And **my inner parts yearned for him** .

Isa. 26:9 **My soul desires You in the night** ; / Indeed my spirit within me seeks You at the dawn; / For when Your judgments are in the earth, / The inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.

Rev. 22:17 **And the Spirit and the bride say, Come! Let him who hears also say, Come! Let him who is thirsty also come** ; he who wills, let him take the water of life freely.

Rev. 22:20 He who testifies these things says, **Yes, I come quickly. Amen. Come, Lord Jesus** !

**Footnotes:**

S.S. 5:41 Her Beloved shows His pierced hand through her narrow opening so that **her inner parts are moved to yearn for Him. Here Christ's pierced hand reminds her that He was crucified for her** .

Rev 22:172 "Come!" is the response of the Spirit and the bride to the Lord's word in v. 16 and to His repeated warning in vv. 7 and 12. It expresses the desire for the Lord's coming. **Whoever hears this response also should say, "Come!" thus expressing a joint desire for the Lord's coming. All believers who love the Lord's appearing (2 Tim. 4:8) should express such a joint desire** .

Rev 22:173 **The Spirit and the bride, on one hand, desire that the Lord will come, and, on the other hand, yearn that the thirsty sinner also will come to take the water of life for his satisfaction** . When we have a sincere desire for the Lord's coming, we also have an earnest concern for the sinner's salvation.

Rev. 22:202 This is the apostle John's prayer and his response to the Lord's warning. It is also the last prayer in the Bible. After hearing this book, **we should all pray such a prayer and have such a response—"Come, Lord Jesus!" The entire Bible concludes with the desire for the Lord's coming expressed as a prayer.**

**Ministry Excerpts** :

" **My beloved put his hand into the opening of the door, / And my inner parts yearned for him"**** ([S.S. 5:]4). Her Beloved showed His pierced hand through her narrow opening so that her inner parts were moved to yearn for Him.** From experience we know that, on the one hand, we may reject the Lord, but, on the other hand, we may not close the door entirely. After closing the door, we may leave a little opening through which the Lord can stretch His hand. Here the Beloved's pierced hand reminded her that He was crucified for her _(Life-Study of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes and Song of Songs, Chapter 16_).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 959** _

1Since Thy departure from Olivet's Mountain,

Why is Thy coming again so delayed?

Thru the long years we have longed for Thy coming;

Hast Thou not heard all the prayers that we've prayed?

Chorus

Come Thou, come now;

Lord, for Thy coming we yearn;

All our desire is Thy promised returning,

Oh, may Thou quickly return.

2Beloved Lord, since the year Thou ascended

Everything here has been tasteless and dry;

Often in praying and often in watching,

In every movement, for Thee, Lord, we sigh.

3Scenes although lovely, yet when will we meet Thee?

Birds and the flowers fair beauty embrace;

All are delightsome, but none satisfy me,

For I am longing for Thy loving face.

4Lord, we're impatient awaiting Thy coming,

We do not know how much longer 'twill be;

From every sunrise to every bright sunset

Hope we each moment Thy coming to see.

5Whene'er 'tis raining, or strong winds are blowing,

Whene'er the moon shines, or rises the sea,

We ever hope to discover Thy coming;

How disappointed when no sign of Thee!

6If it were not for the bidding Thou gav'st us,

We'd be discouraged, Thy service we'd shirk;

But Thou dost want us while waiting Thy coming,

For Thee to live and in diligence work.

7Oh Lord, remember the days have been lengthened

Since Thou hast promised ere going away;

We hope and hope and are endlessly hoping,

That Thou wilt come. Canst Thou come e'en today?

_ **Lord Your Return** _

1. Lord, Your return...How long must it be, dear Lord?The ages have come,The centuries have gone,The years have passed us by.

Lovely One, come soon.  
Precious Lord, return!  
Lord, do not delay.  
We'll redeem everyday  
For Your coming soon.

1. A generation...Lord, of them that seek Your face;A remnant for YouWhose hearts are so true.They're those who just love You.

King of glory come in!  
Saints, open wide to Him.  
O, lift up Your gate,  
It's not too late.  
Let the King come in.

1. A generation...With a goal to bring You back.Their treasure is You,You're their future too.They care for only You.

This goal is deep within,  
A fire that's burning in them.  
They're consumed by this zeal,  
This only is real,  
Lord, to bring You back.

1. A generation...Lord, by You they are possessed.You have captured their heart,The world has no part,Their joy is only You.

They're virgins pure and wise.  
Just You are in their eyes.  
Their hearts make full room  
For You, dear Bridegroom,  
For Your coming soon.

1. Oh, generation...The Spirit and Bride say come —The Spirit's calling you.The Bride is calling too!Take heed to this mingled cry!

Come, oh seekers, come  
To our Groom, most pleasant Person.  
God's eternal plan  
Is to mingle with man.  
This His satisfaction.

1. Oh come, Lord Jesus...For this cause, Lord, strengthen us.Keep us faithful to standAll the way to the end.Uphold us in Your hands.

Come, Lord Jesus, come  
For Your Bride, New Jerusalem.  
Till we meet face to face,  
Fill us daily with grace.  
For that day make haste.

_ **Hymn 280, ss. 1-2 & chorus** _

1Lord, may Thy blood now cleanse me,

Wash all my sins away,

That with Thy Holy Spirit

Thou may anoint, I pray.

My service, I confess, Lord,

Is failure-full and weak;

The filling of Thy Spirit

To live for Thee I seek.

Chorus

Oh, from myself deliver,

From all its misery;

I'd henceforth be forever

Completely filled with Thee.

2Oh, Lord, how dry my heart is,

It yearns and pants for Thee;

The filling of Thy Spirit

Is now my fervent plea.

Within the smitten Rock, Lord,

I would entirely hide;

Pour thru Thy living water,

Till I am satisfied.

84 - Yearn
