**Scriptures** :

Deut. 30:19 I call heaven and earth to witness against you today: I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse; **therefore choose life that you and your seed may live** , 20 **In loving Jehovah your God by listening to His voice and holding fast to Him; for He is your life and the length of your days** , that you may dwell upon the land which Jehovah swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.

Josh. 24:15 And if it seems wrong in your sight to serve Jehovah, **choose for yourselves today whom you will serve** , either the gods from across the River, whom your fathers served, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. But as for me and my house, we will serve Jehovah.

Ruth 1:16 But Ruth said, Do not entreat me to leave you and turn away from following after you. For wherever you go, I will go, and wherever you dwell, I will dwell; and your people will be my people, and **your God will be my God** .

Psa. 84:10 For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand; **/ I would rather stand at the threshold of the house of my God** / Than dwell in the tents of the wicked.

Psa. 119:173 Let Your hand be ready to help me, / **For I have chosen Your precepts** .

Isa. 7:15 He will eat curds and honey until he knows how to refuse evil and **choose good** .

**Footnotes** :

Ruth 1:16, note 1 **Ruth chose the goal of participating with God's elect in the enjoyment of Christ** , and she even became an important ancestor of Christ, one who helped bring forth Christ into mankind. **This was more than just a resolution on the part of the Moabite widow; it was a goal, a choosing. Ruth chose God and His kingdom for the carrying out of God's economy concerning Christ.**

**Ministry Excerpts** :

God created man in a way that was good for man to take God, to receive God, into man as his life. Man was created by God with a mind, an emotion, and a will, and also with a spirit in the center of man's being as a receptacle for him to receive God. Thus, by his mind man can understand what God wants; by his emotion man can like, can love, can prefer, what God wants; and **by his free will man can make a decision to choose God, to take God** . Furthermore, man has a spirit as an organ, even a receptacle, to receive God into him as his life. This is God's intention in His creation of man (_Basic Lessons on Life,_ Chapter 1).

When Adam stood in front of the two trees, he was standing before God and Satan. This formed a triangular situation between man, God, and Satan in the universe. The struggle between God and Satan was upon man. **Whether man will choose God or follow Satan depends completely upon man's choice** . **This triangular situation is now within us.** Once Satan was in the garden outside of Adam; now he is in our flesh. Once God also was in the garden outside of man; now He is in our spirit (_Life-Study of Genesis,_ Chapter 14).

Human beings have a free will. God never infringes upon this and does not change this. He wants man to actively work with Him…He will not choose in our place, allowing our will to lapse into a state of deadness. **He requires active cooperation from us…God in creation established man's free will.** God in redemption regains man's free will. At creation, God did not want man to obey Him mechanically. Therefore, after redemption, He definitely does not want man to follow His direction like a machine. Indeed, God is so great that He does not require man to become wood and stone to submit to Him. **His way is to rely on the working of His Spirit in us; the Spirit causes us to obey Him willingly. But He will never make any decision on our behalf** . The difference here is truly immeasurable (_Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 14: The Spiritual Man (3),_ Chapter 6).

**A spiritual believer is one who has the full power to exercise his own will.**** He should constantly choose God's will and reject Satan's will **. Although many times he cannot tell what is from God and what is from Satan, he can still choose and reject. He can say, "Although I do not know what belongs to God and what belongs to the devil, I will choose God and refuse the devil."** Though he does not know what belongs to God, he can choose God in his "motive" and choose everything that is of God**. He can adopt the attitude that he does not want anything that is from the devil, whatever it may be. Whatever comes upon him, he should choose and reject. It does not matter if he does not know; he still must always choose God's will. He can say, "Whenever I know God's will, I want it. I will always choose God's will and reject Satan's will." By doing this, God's Holy Spirit will work within him, and He will strengthen the will that stands against Satan day by day to the point that Satan will lose his power day by day. Then God will gain one more faithful servant in a rebellious world. When one continuously rejects Satan's will in his motive and asks God to prove what is according to Him, he will realize in his spirit the great role that the attitude of the will plays in the spiritual life (Spiritual Man, The (3 volume set), Chapter 38).

We can all spend at least fifteen minutes to read and pray-read a few verses early every morning. Then we can find time to read a few chapters later in the day. **If we make a decision to practice this, we will be able to do it. We need to choose life by making a decision to practice this. We even need to make a deal with the Lord to spend time in the Word every morning so that we will be accountable to Him concerning this matter** (_Crucial Elements of God's Economy,_ Chapter 1).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 463** _

1I love, I love my Master,

I will not go out free,

For He is my Redeemer;

He paid the price for me.

I would not leave His service,

It is so sweet and blest;

And in the weariest moments

He gives the truest rest.

2My Master shed His life-blood

My vassal life to win,

And save me from the bondage

Of tyrant self and sin.

He chose me for His service,

And gave me power to choose

That blessed, perfect freedom,

Which I shall never lose.

3I would not halve my service,

His only it must be!

His only, who so loved me,

And gave Himself for me.

Rejoicing and adoring,

Henceforth my song shall be,

I love, I love my Master,

I will not go out free.

_ **Hymn 439, ss. 3, 4** _

3Utterly abandoned

To the will of God;

Walking in the pathway

That my Master trod;

Leaving ease and pleasure;

Making Him my choice,

Waiting for His guidance,

Listening for His voice.

Utterly abandoned

To the Lord of all,

Seeking all His fulness,

Answ'ring His dear call.

4Utterly abandoned!

Through eternity;

My will never choosing,

His it e'er shall be;

All my plans and longings

Lost in His sweet will,

Having nothing, owning

All things in Him still.
