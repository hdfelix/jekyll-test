behold, look intently

**Definition**** :**

To look at, to behold, expressing the calm, intent, continuous contemplation of an object which remains before the spectator.

**Scriptures** :

Psa. 27:4 One thing I have asked from Jehovah; / That do I seek: / To dwell in the house of Jehovah / All the days of my life, / **To behold the beauty of Jehovah,** / And to inquire in His temple.

John 1:14 And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (and **we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father** ), full of grace and reality.

2 Cor. 3:18 **But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord** , are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.

Heb. 12:2 **Looking away unto Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of our faith** , who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down on the right hand of the throne of God.

1 John 1:1 That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, **which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld** and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life.

**Footnotes**** :**

2 Cor. 3:18, note 1 But indicates that we believers are different from the children of Israel. They were veiled, but **we with unveiled face behold and reflect like a mirror the glory of the Lord and are thus being transformed into the same image as the Lord from glory to glory** .

2 Cor. 3:18, note 4 **To behold the glory of the Lord is to see the Lord ourselves** ; to reflect the glory of the Lord is to enable others to see Him through us.

2 Cor. 3:18, note 7 **When we with unveiled face are beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord, He infuses us with the elements of what He is and what He has done.** Thus we are being transformed metabolically to have His life shape by His life power with His life essence; that is, we are being transfigured, mainly by the renewing of our mind (Rom. 12:2), into His image. Being transformed indicates that we are in the process of transformation.

Heb. 12:2, note 1 (Looking) **The Greek word translated looking away unto denotes looking with undivided attention by turning away from every other object.** The Hebrew believers had to look away from all the things in their environment, away from their old religion, Judaism, and its persecution, and away from all earthly things, that they might **look unto Jesus, who is now seated on the right hand of the throne of God in the heavens** .

Heb 12:2, note 2 The wonderful Jesus, who is enthroned in heaven and crowned with glory and honor (2:9), is the greatest attraction in the universe. He is like an immense magnet, drawing all His seekers to Him. **It is by being attracted by His charming beauty that we look away from all things other than Him. Without such a charming object, how could we look away from so many distracting things on this earth?**

1 John 1:1, note 3 **(beheld) Gazed at with a purpose** .

1 John 1:1, note 4 **First, have heard, then have seen; after having seen, beheld, gazed at with a purpose, and handled, touched with handsâ€¦**

**Ministry Excerpts:**

We should learn to behold the beauty of the Lord in silence (v. 4). Many Christians have never heard of this practice. **Beholding the beauty of the Lord is to look at the Lord in our spirit and to gaze at Him. When we come before God in prayer, we must learn to stop our speaking, to cut off our words, and to simply turn to our spirit to appear before Him, touch Him, behold Him in silence, and gaze upon Him. We need to look at Him again and again, beholding, appreciating, and even treasuring Him. This is very sweet and necessary** . We should never consider prayer to be merely asking God to do something for us. No, the object and subject of prayer are not things. Both the object and subject of prayer are God Himself. **First we should touch Him. Then we should be silent before Him. After this we should behold Him by looking and gazing at Him. This is to absorb God and enjoy Him** (_How to Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God_, Chapter 5).

Most people understand beholding the Lord to mean looking up at a God who sits far above in the heavens and who sends His light down to men. They consider beholding God to be looking up to such a light. According to our spiritual experience, however, this is not the meaning of beholding God. **Beholding God is to gaze and look at God.**

When I meet with a friend, we typically look each other in the eye and measure each other before we say anything. Sometimes after speaking, we look at each other again before we depart. **Our looking at each other conveys a kind of warmth and intimacy. It is impossible for two persons to speak to each other without looking at each other. In the same way, beholding God means to gaze on Him when we pray. After we pray a few sentences, we should turn to gaze on Him again.** If we do not turn to God or do not fix our gaze on Him but instead hastily utter a few words, it will be difficult for us to enjoy God. **When we pray, we must be calm, turn to our spirit, and gaze on Him. Then according to the feeling within, we can speak to Him under His gaze.** We should continually behold Him. Such beholding is very precious (_How to Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God_, Chapter 21).

**The believers are being transformed bybeholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord** . In 2 Corinthians 3:18 the words "beholding and reflecting as a mirror" are the translation of a single word in Greek. The use of this word in 3:18 is metaphorical. On the one hand, a mirror beholds a person or an object. On the other hand, a mirror reflects what it beholds. These are the two aspects of the function of a mirror.Beholding is to see the Lord for ourselves; reflecting is for others to see the Lord through us.

Today the glory is the resurrected Christ, and this Christ is the Spirit. This means that the Lord as the glory is the Spirit living in us and dwelling in our spirit. **Now that we have the Spirit indwelling our spirit, we need to exercise our spirit more and more by praying, reading the Word, and calling on the name of the Lord. The more we exercise our spirit with an unveiled face, the more we shall behold the Lord. As we are gazing on Him, we shall also reflect Him. While we are beholding and reflecting Him in this way, His element will be added into our being** . This new element will replace and discharge the element of our old, natural life, and we shall experience transformation, a metabolic change (_The Conclusion of the New Testament Messages_ 135-156, Chapter 13).

**We are all busy in the morning, but we must do our best to save ten or fifteen minutes each day to behold the Lord. To do this is not a waste of time** . If possible, we should reduce our time for sleep. If we normally rise at six o'clock in the morning, we can gain fifteen minutes by rising fifteen minutes earlier. If we take another ten minutes from the time given to our business, we can have a total of twenty-five minutes for beholdingthe Lord each day. **By beholding****  ****Him we will receive an element from the Lord that will transform us into the glorious image of Christ, even from glory to glory. This is the way to enjoy Christ** (_The Central Line of the Divine Revelation_, Chapter 17).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 172, s. 2** _

I cannot gaze enough on Thee,  
 Thou Fairest of the Fair;  
My heart is filled with ecstasy,  
As in Thy face of radiancy  
 I see such beauty there.

_ **Hymn 812, ss. 1-3** _

1.I come to Thee, dear Lord,

My heart doth thirst for Thee;

Of Thee I'd eat, of Thee I'd drink.

Enjoy Thee thoroughly.

2.Just to behold Thy face,

For this my heart doth cry;

I deeply long to drink of Thee

My thirst to satisfy.

3. Thy glorious, radiant face

My heart delights to see;

Here I'd abide and ne'er depart,

Beholding constantly.

_ **Hymn 813, ss. 1- 3** _

1I come before Thy throne of grace

With hungry heart on Thee to feed,

Thy grace and mercy to receive

To help me in this hour of need.

2Here I behold Thy radiant face,

Its light upon my heart doth shine

With healing rays consuming all

The weaknesses and faults of mine.

3'Tis here Thy light illuminates

My true condition unto me;

'Tis here Thy blood's effectiveness

To cleanse from sin I gladly see.

_ **Take time to Absorb Him, s. 5** _

Take time to behold Him, gaze oft on His face,  
Receiving His Person, and grace upon grace.  
By His pleasant shining, infused we will be;  
Our faces will glow with His light, radiantly.
