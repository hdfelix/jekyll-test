sigh

**Scriptures** :

Psa. 38:8 I am benumbed and crushed utterly; / **I cry out due to the groaning of my heart. 9 O Lord, all my desire is before You, / And my groaning is not hidden from You** .

Rom. 8:23 And not only so, but **we ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan in ourselves, eagerly awaiting sonship, the redemption of our body** .

Rom. 8:26 Moreover, in like manner the Spirit also joins in to help us in our weakness, for we do not know for what we should pray as is fitting, but **the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered** .

**Footnotes** :

Psa 38:8, note 1 **Groaning here indicates that the psalmist had an inward burden to pray, but he did not know what to say. Hence, all he could do was groan** . See note 262 in Rom. 8.

Rom 8:23, note 2 (groan) Although we have the divine Spirit as the firstfruits in our spirit, our body has not yet been saturated with the divine life. **Our body is still the flesh, linked to the old creation, and it is still a body of sin and death that is impotent in the things of God. Hence, we groan together with the creation (vv. 19, 22) and eagerly await the glorious day when we will obtain the full sonship, the redemption and transfiguration of our body** , and will be freed from the slavery of corruption.

Rom 8:26, note 1 In like manner indicates that prior to the help of the Spirit mentioned in this verse, there was already another help of the Spirit, which must be the help rendered to us by the Spirit as the firstfruits mentioned in v. 23. This is confirmed by the fact that both v. 23 and this verse speak of our groaning.

Rom 8:26, note 2 **The weakness here is our ignorance of how we should pray. We do not know the kind of prayer God desires, and we are not clear how to pray, according to the burden we feel, for our being conformed to the image of God's Son; hence, we groan (v. 23). In our groaning the Spirit groans also, interceding for us** . His interceding is mainly that we may experience the transformation in life for growth into the maturity of sonship that we may be fully conformed to the image of God's Son.

**Ministry Excerpts** :

Paul continues to say, "For we do not know for what we should pray as is fitting, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered." **The Spirit intercedes for us with groanings in our manner. This groaning apparently is our groaning, but in our groaning is the groaning of the Spirit. This is why His groaning is in the same manner as our groaning. He is in us and His groaning is in our groaning. He groans with us "in like manner." This is the best prayer we can have for the growth in life** . Most of our prayers are very utterable with clear words, but they may not be out of our spirit. But **when we have a real burden to pray yet we do not know how to utter it, then spontaneously we just groan with that burden without any utterable word** . This will be the best prayer within which the Spirit intercedes for us by groaning together with us.

This kind of unutterable prayer is primarily for the growth in life, concerning the true need of which we do not have much understanding. Concerning our material needs and business affairs we are clear and do have the utterance to pray about these things, but concerning the matter of our growth in life we are lacking in both understanding and utterance. However **, if we are seeking the Lord regarding the growth in life, oftentimes deep within our spirit we will be burdened with some prayer about which we have no clear understanding and for which we have no utterance. So, spontaneously we are forced to groan. While we are groaning from deep within our spirit, the Spirit who dwells in our spirit automatically joins in with our groaning, interceding for us mainly that we may have the transformation in life for growth into the maturity of sonship** (_Life-Study of Romans,_ Chapter 19).

**While we are groaning, the Holy Spirit also is groaning** . While we are expecting, He is expecting. While we are hoping and enduring, He is hoping and enduring. Whatever we are, He is also the same. In like manner the Spirit joins in to help us. What a comfort this is! **While we are groaning, watching, and expecting, the Spirit also is groaning, watching, and expecting. He is the same as we are** . If we are weak, He apparently is weak also, although actually He is not. He sympathizes with our weakness. He appears to be weak for the sake of our weakness in order to participate in it. When we pray loudly, He also prays loudly. He also prays softly when we pray softly. We may say, "O Father, I am pitiful. Have mercy on me." When we pray in this way, the Spirit prays for us in like manner. In whatever way we pray, He also prays. In whatever we are, He also is. If we pray quickly, rejoicingly, and shoutingly, He also prays in this manner. Our manner is His manner (_Conclusion of the New Testament, The (Msgs. 079-098),_ Chapter 14, p. 987).

The interceding Spirit helps us, sympathizes with us, sustains us, comforts us, and supports us by interceding for us. At times we may feel weak and depressed. But within us, even at such times, there is something sustaining, supporting, encouraging, and comforting us. There is something within us telling us not to be disappointed. **Although we are weak, there is a support within us. There is even a certain kind of prayer going on within us and for us. This is the work of the interceding Spirit, and this is the intercession of the helping Spirit, who understands us thoroughly** . The Spirit helps us in every kind of situation, for He knows our needs, problems, and shortcomings, and He sympathizes with us, supports us, and sustains us (_Conclusion of the New Testament, The (Msgs. 079-098),_ Chapter 14, pp. 988-989).

There is no need to be formal or to have a good composition in our prayers. Instead, we should speak freely with the Lord. The more we practice to pray in this way, the more we will pray in simple words, even in single words. **Many times we may simply sigh in our prayer. These sighs are like the "selah" in the Psalms or like the rests in musical notations. This makes our prayer more meaningful. After praying for a while, we can pause for refreshment and a rest, a selah.** We should not rush or utter something too quickly. Our resting gives the Lord a chance to utter something. If we have a small silence in our speaking, the Lord will give us further utterance. Sometimes we need to rest and even grope for utterance. This will give the Lord a chance to impress us with some new utterance. It is easy to practice our personal times of prayer in this way (_Enjoying Christ as the Word and the Spirit through Prayer,_ Chapter 9, p. 86).

Prayer is our spiritual breathing before God and in God. **Even though we often do not know what to say when we wait on God, there is a sighing within us. This sighing can be compared to breathing. Our experience shows that when we sigh a little, the weight on our shoulder disappears. We are fully released and rested, and we overflow with a sense of sweetness** . We may often find ourselves sinking into darkness and confusion within, not knowing which path we should take, what we should do, or even how we should pray. **But while we wait on the Lord, we utter a sigh from deep in our being. It is interesting that after sighing for a while, the darkness and confusion vanish, and we become clear and uncluttered, knowing the way to proceed** . This wonderful experience is the meaning of prayer. Real prayer is nothing but waiting on God and breathing in God. When we breathe, we exhale everything that we are and inhale everything that God is (_How to Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God,_ Chapter 5, pp. 58-59).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 764, ss. 1-3** _

1Lord, in Thy presence silent I would be,

That in the inmost I to Thee may come;

I would not in my own way pray to Thee,

But let Thy prayer in me my prayer become.

2It seems Thou art in heaven hearing me,

But right within my spirit Thou dost dwell;

It seems that I am praying unto Thee,

But really from Thyself the prayers do well.

3When, Lord, no words my burden can express,

My spirit with Thy Spirit deeply groans;

Not verbally I then my plea address,

But Thou dost pray within with words unknown.

_ **Hymn 780** _

1Praying always in the spirit,

Never in the flesh or mind!

If this secret we will practise,

God's full presence we will find.

Chorus

Praying always in the spirit

Is the secret we are told!

In the spirit, God to contact,

Is the secret we must hold!

2Praying always in the spirit,

Never by our human thought!

Fellowship with God the Spirit

Only thus to us is brought.

3Praying always in the spirit,

Thus expressing God's desire;

Staying with the Lord in spirit,

We'll be wholly set afire.

4Praying always in the spirit,

Even groaning from within,

Thus we utter God's intention

By the Spirit's discipline.

5Praying always in the spirit,

In the holiest place divine;

It is only in the spirit

God and we in oneness twine.

6Praying always in the spirit,

'Tis the only way of prayer;

All the fulness of the Godhead

By this secret we may share.

_ **Hymn 745, ss. 1, 6** _

1O Lord, Thou art the Spirit now

Who in our spirit lives;

One spirit have the two become,

Which oneness to us gives.

6In spirit, with Thy Spirit, Lord,

We offer prayer to Thee,

While, as the Spirit, Thou in us

Groanest unutterably.
