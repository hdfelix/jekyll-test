hoping in Him, daily hope

**Scriptures** :

Psa. 43:5 Why are you cast down, O my soul? / And why are you disquieted within me? / **Hope in God** , for I will yet praise Him, / The salvation of my countenance and my God.

Psa. 119:74 Those who fear You will see me and rejoice, / **For I have hoped in Your word.**

Rom. 15:4 For the things that were written previously were written for our instruction, in order that **through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope** .

1 Cor. 13:13 **Now there abide faith, hope, love,** these three; and the greatest of these is love.

1 Tim. 4:10 For to this end we labor and strive, because **we have set our hope on the living God** , who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.

1 Pet. 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has **regenerated us unto a living hope** through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,

**Footnotes** :

1 Cor. 13:131 Faith receives the divine things (John 1:12) and substantiates the spiritual and unseen things (Heb. 11:1). **Hope reaps and partakes of the things substantiated by faith** (Rom. 8:24-25). Love enjoys the things received and substantiated by faith and **partaken of by hope** , for nourishing ourselves, building up others (8:1), and expressing God, thus fulfilling the entire law (Rom. 13:8-10). Such love causes us to grow in life for the development and use of the spiritual gifts, and it is the most excellent way to have the greater gifts. Hence, it is the greatest of the three abiding virtues. So we must pursue it (14:1).

Heb. 11:13 The unbelievers, being without Christ, have no hope (Eph. 2:12; 1 Thes. 4:13). But **we, the believers in Christ, are a people of hope.**** The calling that we receive from God brings us hope **(Eph. 1:18; 4:4). We have been regenerated unto a living hope (1 Pet. 1:3). Our Christ, who is in us, is the hope of glory (Col. 1:27; 1 Tim. 1:1), which will issue in the redemption, the transfiguration, of our body in glory (Rom. 8:23-25). This is the hope of salvation (1 Thes. 5:8), a blessed hope (Titus 2:13), a good hope (2 Thes. 2:16), the hope of eternal life (Titus 1:2; 3:7); it is also the hope of the glory of God (Rom. 5:2), the hope of the gospel (Col. 1:23), the hope laid up for us in the heavens (Col. 1:5). We should keep this hope always (1 John 3:3) and boast in it (Rom. 5:2). Our God is the God of hope (Rom. 15:13), and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we can have hope (Rom. 15:4) all the time in God (1 Pet. 1:21) and can rejoice in it (Rom. 12:12). This book charges us to hold fast the boast of hope firm to the end (3:6), to show diligence unto the full assurance of our hope until the end (6:11), and to lay hold of the hope set before us (6:18). It also tells us that the new covenant brings in a better hope, through which we draw near to God (7:19).** Our life should be a life of hope, which accompanies and abides with faith (1 Pet. 1:21; 1 Cor. 13:13). We should follow Abraham, who beyond hope believed in hope (Rom. 4:18)**.

1 Pet. 1:36 **A hope for the future in our sojourning today—not a hope of objective things but a hope of life, even eternal life, with all the endless divine blessings** . Such a hope should cause us to set our hope perfectly on the coming grace (v. 13).

The living hope, the hope of life, brought to the regenerated believers through regeneration, can be likened to the various expectations for the future brought to parents through the birth of a newborn babe; all such expectations hinge on the life of the newborn child. **Likewise, the life that we, the believers, have received through regeneration enables us to have a hope, with numerous aspects, for this age, for the coming age, and for eternity. In this age we have the hope of growing in life, of maturing, of manifesting our gifts, of exercising our functions, of being transformed, of overcoming, of being redeemed in our body, and of entering into glory. In the coming age we have the hope of entering into the kingdom, of reigning with the Lord, and of enjoying the blessings of the eternal life in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. In eternity we have the hope of being in the New Jerusalem, where we will participate fully in the consummated blessings of the eternal life in its ultimate manifestation in eternity** . This living hope, the hope of life, hinges on the eternal life, which we received through regeneration. Only the divine life can enable us to grow in the divine life until we grow into the reality of the hope that is brought to us by that life. Thus we will obtain the various blessings mentioned above as our inheritance, which is incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading and is kept for eternity (vv. 3-4).

**Ministry Excerpts** :

I would quote a word from Dean Alford: "The resurrection of Christ, bringing in life and the gift of the life-giving Spirit, is that which potentiates the new birth into a living hope." The concept here is deep. The resurrection of Christ potentiates our regeneration into a living hope. When we were regenerated, the resurrected Christ entered into us. He is not only the living One—He is also the resurrected One. **Now He is the life within us that potentiates the new birth and causes every aspect of our being to become living. Therefore, regeneration results in a living hope** (_Life-Study of 1 Peter,_ Chapter 3).

When some hear that we may enjoy the living hope today, they may argue and say, "How can you claim that the living hope is a present matter? Something present can never be a hope. Romans 8 gives us a description of hope. That chapter tells us that hope refers to things that we have not seen." **Those who would try to argue in this way need to realize that the living hope, the inheritance, is ours today, tomorrow, and for eternity. With our present enjoyment we have a hope. This means that our enjoyment of the divine life is a hope.** For example, perhaps early in the day you may have a failure in your Christian life. Nevertheless, even though you have failed, you still have a hope. You may say to yourself, "I'm very weak, yet I still have hope. My experience may be poor, but I have hope. Perhaps even later today my experience will be uplifted." Do you not have such a hope within you? **We all have this living hope. Day by day we live a life of living hope** (_Life-Study of 1 Peter,_ Chapter 6).

**We may also use a carnation seed to illustrate what Peter means by a living hope, a hope of life. If you were to sow a carnation seed in your yard, you would sow it with hope. You would have the expectation that the seed would eventually sprout** . After a period of time, you would expect to have a full-grown carnation plant with blossoms on it. This is an illustration of the hope of life….A dead person has no hope. However, if life could be imparted into a dead person, he would have the hope that every member of his physical body would be enlivened. In principle, the same applies to our regeneration. Before we were regenerated, we were dead and without hope. **But the eternal life that has been sown into us is full of hope, full of the hope of life** .

**The hope of life is the enjoyment of eternal life** . **This enjoyment is not only for the future; it is for us to experience today. To enjoy this living hope is to enjoy eternal life. This eternal life enables us to change. Furthermore, the enjoyment of eternal life is the fulfillment of the hope of life** . Of course, the full enjoyment of eternal life will be in the future. But today we may have a foretaste. Then in the future we shall enjoy the full taste. But both the foretaste and the full taste are the fulfillment of the hope of this life. Therefore, this hope is actually the enjoyment of eternal life. (_Life-Study of 1 Peter,_ Chapter 4).

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 298, s. 1 & chorus** _

1My hope is built on nothing less  
Than Jesus Christ, my righteousness;  
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,  
But wholly lean on Jesus' name.

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;  
All other ground is sinking sand,  
All other ground is sinking sand.

_ **Hymn 708** _

1Fresh as the dew of the morning,

Bringing a sweet rest unheard,

Christ, in the gentle anointing,

Whispers His comforting word:

Stand till the trial is over,

Stand till the tempest is gone,

Stand for the glory of Jesus,

Stand till the kingdom is won.

Chorus

Lord of all hope, O how

sweet is Thy voice,

Making my heart in Thy

presence rejoice.

2If in the test of my trouble,

Faint be my spirit and heart,

Faith, with the star of hope glimm'ring,

Shall all be taken apart,

May then Thy faith with Thy life-pow'r

Over me hold its full sway

That all Thy riches of glory

Now I may share and for aye.

3Lord, as the morning sun dawning,

Chase all my darkness away,

And with Thy kind wings of healing

Turn all my night into day.

Come Thou, O come, Lord of comfort,

Come to my sad, weary heart,

Come, O Thou blest hope of glory,

Never, O never depart.

_ **Hymn 389, s. 4** _

4Each time when of heavenly blessings I think,

O let my heart long to be raptured to Thee;

My only hope here is Thy coming again,

My only joy there, Lord, Thy presence will be.

Lord, teach me each day in Thy presence to live,

From morning to evening my one world Thou art;

O let not my heart be contented or rest

When loving or seeking what with Thee doth part.
