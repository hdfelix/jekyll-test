**Scriptures** :

1 Chron. 16:11 **Seek Jehovah and His strength; / Seek His face continually.**

Psa. 27:8 When **You say, Seek My face, / To You my heart says, Your face, O Jehovah, will I seek** .

Psa. 119:2 **Blessed are those** who keep His testimonies, / **Who seek Him with all their heart** .

Isa. 55:6 **Seek Jehovah while He may be found** ; / Call upon Him while He is near.

Jer. 29:13 And **you will seek Me and find Me if you search for Me with all your heart** .

Amos 5:4 For thus says Jehovah to the house of Israel, / **Seek Me, and live** .

Matt. 6:33 But **seek first His kingdom and His righteousness** , and all these things will be added to you.

Matt. 7:7 Ask and it shall be given to you; **seek and you shall find** ; knock and it shall be opened to you.

Col. 3:1 If therefore you were raised together with Christ, **seek the things which are above, where Christ is** , sitting at the right hand of God.

Heb. 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to Him, for he who comes forward to God must believe that He is and that **He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him** .

**Footnotes**** :**

Gen. 5:24, note 1 Enoch was the first person to be raptured. By this he escaped death, the ultimate issue of man's fall (Heb. 11:5). This first mentioning of the rapture establishes the principle of the rapture: our being raptured depends on our being mature in the divine life by our walking with God. Enoch walked with God day and night for three hundred years. According to Heb. 11:5-6, **he did this by faith, believing that God is and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him. After three hundred years of seeking God and walking with Him, Enoch was taken by God, thus obtaining the reward of not seeing death.**

Psa. 119:2, note 2, par. 1 There are two kinds of people in relation to the law: (1) the letter-keepers, illustrated by the Judaizers and Saul of Tarsus (Phil. 3:6b), and (2) **the God-seekers, illustrated by the psalmists, especially by the writer of this psalm, and by the apostle Paul** (2 Cor. 3:6). **As a lover of God, the psalmist sought God with all his heart, loved God's name and remembered it (vv. 132, 55), sought God's favor by entreating His countenance** (v. 58), asked God to cause His face to shine upon him (v. 135), walked in God's presence (v. 168), considered God's law to be His living and loving word breathed out of His mouth (vv. 13, 72, 88; cf. 2 Tim. 3:16), tasted God's word and found it sweeter than honey to his mouth (v. 103), esteemed God's word as more precious than fine gold (v. 127), and considered God's word a lamp to his feet and a light to his path (v. 105).

Eccl. 3:11, note 1 (eternity) "A divinely implanted sense of purpose working through the ages, which nothing under the sun, but only God, can satisfy" (The Amplified Bible). God created man in His image and formed in him a spirit that man may receive and contain Him (Gen. 1:26 and note 3; 2:7 and note 5). In addition, **God put eternity, an aspiration for something eternal, in man's heart so that man will seek God, the eternal One.** Hence, temporal things can never satisfy man; only the eternal God, who is Christ, can satisfy the deep sense of purpose in man's heart (cf. 2 Cor. 4:18). See note 41 in S.S. 1.

S.S. 3:2, note 1 Eventually, Christ's lover has no choice but to answer His call, and **she determines to rise up from her introspection to seek her Beloved in the ways (streets and squares) of the heavenly Jerusalem** (typified here by the city Jerusalem on earth—Heb. 12:22).

Isa. 55:6, note 1 ( **Seek) This is to come to the Lord in order to drink of Him** (v. 1).

Jer. 32:39, note 1 **We, the chosen people of God, should all have one heart—to love God, to seek God, to live God, and to be constituted with God that we may be His expression** —and one way—the Triune God Himself as the inner law of life with its divine capacity (31:33-34; John 14:6a). This one heart and one way are the one accord (Acts 1:14; 2:46; 4:24; Rom. 15:6). Divisions result from having a heart for something other than Christ and taking a way other than Christ.

Matt. 7:7, note 1 First ask, then seek, and last knock. To ask is to pray in a common way, **to seek is to supplicate in a specific way** , and to knock is to demand in the most intimate and most earnest way.

Col. 3:1, note 2 This is the raising aspect of baptism, which is altogether contrary to asceticism. We were raised together with Christ. We are now where Christ is, sitting in the heavens. Hence, in contrast to the ascetics, we should not practice the things on the earth. **We should seek the things that are in the heavens, such as knowing Christ as everything to us, so that we take Him as life and thereby walk in Him** .

Col 3:1, note 3 I.e., in the heavens; in contrast to on the earth in v. 2. **The heavens are linked to Christ and joined to the church. The things above include the ascended Christ and all things pertaining to Him. Therefore, to seek the things above is to seek to live Christ in and with the church** .

**Ministry Excerpts** :

There is a real need, especially for the new and young believers who have not been built up in this way, to daily spend some time with the Lord, at least half an hour a day. I would recommend that you have a morning time, but if that is not convenient, you can use other times. The best time, however, is the morning. If possible, you must build up such a habit to spend at least half an hour to be with the Lord every day. Make this your top regulation. During this time simply read the word, understanding it spontaneously, but mostly spending your time in prayer. Do not try to read too much, and do not try to understand too much. Rather, always spend more and more time in prayer. I do not mean that you should bring many items to the Lord. Instead, simply pray according to what you understand. As to your needs, leave that to the Lord's care. **We have the promise that if we seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, our Father will take care of whatever we need (Matt. 6:33). You have to stand on this promise. Simply seek the Lord Himself; seek His kingdom, and seek His righteousness.** Then forget about your need, or rather, leave your need to His care. (_Practical Lessons on the Experience of Life_, Chapter 13)

**We must simultaneously seek the Lord and His Word. First we need to seek the Lord** . **Whenever we are going to read the Scripture, even before we open the Bible, we should pray.** It does not matter whether it is in the morning, in the evening, or at noontime; whenever you open the Bible, before you read the Lord's Word, you should always pray first. You do not have to follow any formalities, so you may either kneel or sit. The only thing you need to do is spontaneously express the feelings in your heart. This expression of your heart is prayer, and it is the coming forth of your spirit: **"O Lord, I love You. I thank You that now I am coming to read Your Word." All it takes is a short, simple prayer like this for you to seek the Lord.** Do not despise this simple practice; it is truly precious. You do not need to say the same thing every time, because it is not a matter of what you say. **The point is that you pray, showing that your heart is turned to the Lord and that you are seeking the Lord.** (_A Living of Mutual Abiding with the Lord in Spirit_ **,** Chapter 8)

**To seek the things above and to set our mind on them is to live Christ, to have one living with Him** . When Christ prays in heaven, we should pray on earth. This means that there is a transmission between the Christ praying in heaven and us praying on earth. By means of this transmission we may pray in oneness with Him. We respond on earth to Christ's praying in heaven. None of us should be unemployed. We all have the responsibility to respond to Christ's heavenly transmission. **We need to live together with Christ by seeking the things which are above and setting our mind on them.** Christ is in heaven interceding, ministering, and administrating, and we are on earth responding to Christ's activity in heaven. (_Life-Study of Colossians_, Chapter 60)

**Hymns** :

_ **Hymn 1154, s. 1** _

I love Thee, Jesus,

And Thy love to me

Draws me, ever to seek Thee

And run after Thee,

Draws me, ever to seek Thee

And run after Thee.

Thou art beloved,

Yea! Altogether lovely,

The One in whom my heart delighteth.

_ **Hymn 784, s. 1 & Chorus (same as s.1)** _

Pray to fellowship with Jesus,

In the spirit seek His face;

Ask and listen in His presence,

Waiting in the secret place.

_ **Hymn 578, s. 4** _

Thou art my Savior, strength and stay,

O Lord, I come to seek Thy face;

Though I'm the weakest of the weak,

My strength is nothing but Thy grace.

_ **Hymn 283, s. 1 & Chorus** _

Lord, Thou knowest all the hunger

Of the heart that seeks Thee now;

How my soul hath long been craving

What Thou only canst bestow.

Seeking now, seeking now,

Let Thy Spirit meet me now.
